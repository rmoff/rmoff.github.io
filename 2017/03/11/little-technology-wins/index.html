<h3 id="wireless-headset-for-voip-with-no-30-minute-dalek-timebomb">Wireless Headset for VOIP With No 30-Minute Dalek Timebomb</h3>

<p>A lot of my work is done remotely, with colleagues and customers. Five years ago I bought a <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Microsoft-JUG-00014-LifeChat-LX-3000-Headset">Microsoft LifeChat LX-3000</a> which plugged into the USB port on my Mac. It did the job kinda fine, with two gripes:</p>

<ol>
<li>it wasn&rsquo;t wireless. I like to wander whilst I chat, and I didn&rsquo;t like being tethered. But this in itself wasn&rsquo;t a reason to ditch it</li>
<li>After c.30 minutes on a call, my voice would turn into a dalek. or rather, my voice wouldn&rsquo;t but the audio that others heard was.
This happened regardless of platform (Hangouts / Zoom / Skype / etc). I figured it must be a software or network issue. Never got to the bottom of it, until I switched to using a Snowball microphone for some proper <a href="https://www.drilltodetail.com/podcast/2016/12/20/drill-to-detail-ep14-christmas-new-year-special-with-special-guest-robin-moffatt">voice recording</a> - and any calls I happened to also make on it no longer had the Dalek problem.</li>
</ol>

<p>So I switched, on a colleague&rsquo;s recommendation, to the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Logitech-H600-Wireless-Headset-Mac/">Logitech H600</a>. I love it. The wireless works flawlessly, and no dalek effect. Gripes? Well there&rsquo;s no pleasing some people. The audio quality is great for calls, but for music I switch back to my wireless <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Avantree-Comfortable-Bluetooth-Headphones-Lightweight">Avantree Auditions</a>. The Logitech headset also feels a bit plastic, which I don&rsquo;t care about unless I&rsquo;m back here in six months complaining that it&rsquo;s broken&hellip;.</p>

<h3 id="apple-watch-2-plus-bluetooth-headphones">Apple Watch 2 plus Bluetooth Headphones</h3>

<p>Eighteen months ago I took up running, since for the past 37 years I&rsquo;d done all I could to avoid exercise, and with my fondness for [beer]() and [fryups](), it was time to do something to try and influence the statistics of health problems back in my favour&hellip;</p>

<p>Being a geek, I obviously had to track my runs, which I did at first with MapMyRun on my iPhone, eventually investing in a <a href="https://www.polar.com/uk-en/products/sport/M400">Polar M400</a>. It&rsquo;s a great phone for tracking running, and synced nicely with <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/10250052/">Strava</a> - but it didn&rsquo;t do anything else as a &lsquo;smart watch&rsquo;. It mirrored notifications from my iPhone but in a fairly lame way. Then along came Apple Watch 2, which unlike the original Apple Watch has in-built GPS meaning that you can track your runs without needing to have a phone - and being an Apple Watch does lots of very cool &lsquo;smart watch&rsquo; stuff.</p>

<p>On my runs I listen to podcasts, and previously had done this using an old Nexus 4 that I had, with a pair of MPow Swift Bluetooth Headphones. This worked great. Then I realised that the Apple Watch 2 can pair directly with headphones! At first it refused to pair with the MPow Swift, but after a bit of Googling I found that by first deleting the pairing from my Nexus 4 to the headphones, I could then pair them fine to the Apple Watch 2. Following <a href="http://www.idownloadblog.com/2015/04/28/how-to-sync-podcasts-apple-watch/">this convoluted method</a> I can get podcasts on my Apple Watch 2 &hellip;</p>

<p><img src="/content/images/2017/02/IMG_2057.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>So my little tech win is being able to go for a run with just my Apple Watch 2 and MPow Swift headphones, track my run with GPS (using Strava&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.strava.com/apple-watch?hl=en-GB">new support for Watch-only tracking</a>), and listen to podcasts!</p>

<p><em>Little technology fail : I&rsquo;ve actually reverted to going running with my Nexus 4, because I got fed up manually trying to sync podcasts to my watch. For the benefit of not carrying a phone, it just wasn&rsquo;t worth it. The Podcast Addict app on the Nexus does a great job of automatically downloading new episodes so that they&rsquo;re just there and ready for me to listen to when I go out.</em></p>
