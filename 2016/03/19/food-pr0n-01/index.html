<article class="center bg-white br-3 pv1 ph4 lh-copy f5 nested-links mw7">
	<p>One of the perks of my job is that I get to travel to some pretty nice places (hi, San Francisco, Bergen, Åland Islands), and get to eat some pretty good food too. If you&rsquo;re looking for some techie content, then move along and go and read about <a href="http://rmoff.net/2016/03/16/oracle-goldengate-kafka-hive-on-bigdatalite-4-4/">Kafka</a>, but if you enjoy food pr0n then stay put.</p>
<p>I was working for a client in the centre of Manchester this week, staying as usual at a Premier Inn. I&rsquo;m a big fan of my <a href="http://rmoff.net/2016/02/26/fullenglish/">fried breakfasts</a>, and whilst never anything to write home about (or indeed write a blog about) Premier Inn breakfasts are generally fine for what they are &ndash; but this one was a real disappointment. Even with the excitement of seeing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_and_squeak">bubble and squeak</a>, it was a real let down; luke warm, and the sausages in particular tasted really artificially flavoured.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2016/03/IMG_3694--1--2.JPG" alt="Premier Inn Fryup - hopefully just a blip on their record of &lsquo;not bad&rsquo; usually"></p>
<p>Fortunately my eating the rest of the week more than made up for having to settle for a bowl of bran flakes for breakfast. At lunchtime my colleague and I were really spoilt by the nearby venue <strong><a href="http://thekitchensleftbank.com/">The Kitchens</a></strong>. Within it there&rsquo;s separate little businesses each making a different type of food. It was so good we went back each day to try something different:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pick of the bunch was definitely <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/thehiphopchippy">The Hip Hop Chip Shop</a></strong>. Their &ldquo;<strong>Meat Junkie Meal</strong>&rdquo; was fabulously awesome. Picture this : a really good sausage. Not the kind of crap that Premier Inn are served up (see above), but a really well made sausage. Now wrap it in good quality bacon. Now batter it, and deep fry it. As if that wasn&rsquo;t enough, serve it with some of the best onion rings I&rsquo;ve ever tasted, really good chips &ndash; and a fantastic chip shop gravy with a cheeky bit of chilli in it.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2016/03/IMG_3698.jpg" alt="Meat Junkie Meal"></p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no way you&rsquo;d eat this more than once in a while given the amount of fried material in one serving, but my god, it&rsquo;s worth the risk of coronary disease (and 3rd degree burns from the battered sausage)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next up was <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/bangersandbacon">Bangers and Bacon</a></strong>. I&rsquo;d never even heard of a Cubano sandwich before let alone tasted one, but after this gem I&rsquo;ll be sure to look out for them. Pork, ham, cheese, mustard, and pickles - what&rsquo;s not to be liked in that! I&rsquo;m a bit of a sucker for anything with a good pickle in it to be honest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Last was <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/wellhungkitchen">Well Hung</a></strong>. My first ever Philly Cheesesteak Sandwich wasn&rsquo;t quite the revelation of the Cubano above, but still a pretty decent sandwich.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Neck-and-neck with the Meat Junkie Meal for accolade of &ldquo;meal of the week&rdquo; was the magnificence of both the starter and main I had for an evening meal at <a href="http://www.beefandpudding.co.uk/">Beef and Pudding</a>. The &ldquo;Bury Bomb&rdquo; was Black Pudding with Lancashire cheese wrapped in potato, and astoundingly good:</p>
<p><img src="/images/2016/03/IMG_3687.jpg" alt="Bury Bomb"></p>
<p>Something rarely seen on restaurant menus, and for shame really, is the suet pudding. This one was filled with chunks of beef and served with mash, mushy peas, and gravy - and was superb.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2016/03/IMG_3689.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Elsewhere my evening meals took me to <a href="http://thehawksmoor.com/locations/manchester/">Hawksmoor</a> for a very good burger (make sure you get the shortribs with it):</p>
<p><img src="/images/2016/03/IMG_3692.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>and to <a href="http://www.mowglistreetfood.com/">Mowgli</a> for some interesting Indian &ldquo;Street Food&rdquo;, the highlight of which was a ginger and rhubarb dhal:</p>
