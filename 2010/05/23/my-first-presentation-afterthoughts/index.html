<article class="center bg-white br-3 pv1 ph4 lh-copy f5 nested-links mw8">
	<p>I delivered my first presentation today, at the <a href="http://www.rittmanmead.com/biforum2010/">RittmanMead BI Forum</a>.I was really nervous in the hours and minutes leading up to it, but once I got up there and started talking I actually quite enjoyed it. If you were in the audience, I&rsquo;d love some feedback in the comments section below, particularly any &ldquo;constructive criticism&rdquo;. I obviously didn&rsquo;t make too much of a mess of it, as I was awarded &ldquo;best speaker&rdquo; of the event, which was a great honour. Hopefully I&rsquo;ll get the opportunity to present again soon, perhaps at an UKOUG event.</p>
<p>You can <a href="/2010/05/24/performance-testing-and-obiee/">download the presentation here</a>.</p>
<p>Whilst I was writing the presentation I went through a lot of versions (iterative, huh), as having never delivered a presentation before it took me a while to figure out how to go about writing it. Here are my thoughts that I jotted down during the process, and which hopefully may help someone else:</p>
<ul>
<li>You&rsquo;re writing a presentation, not a paper. You don&rsquo;t have to cite every reference or prove every example.</li>
<li>You&rsquo;re writing a presentation, not a classroom training session. You don&rsquo;t have to necessarily detail every step to do what you&rsquo;re doing.</li>
<li>What do you want your audience to leave with?</li>
<li>What are you adding by being there that they couldn&rsquo;t get from a well written blog post or white paper?</li>
</ul>
<p>This post was useful: <a href="http://www.simple-talk.com/opinion/opinion-pieces/creating-technical-presentations/">Creating technical presentations</a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;d strongly recommend <em><strong>talking</strong></em> through your slides, ideally with a colleague but even to your dog &ndash; you&rsquo;ll find some transitions really grate, and some slides you&rsquo;ve talked about before even getting to them and skip over - that&rsquo;s a sign you should drop them.</p>
<p>Someone mentioned &ldquo;The Curve&rdquo; to me, and if you think of good presentations you&rsquo;ve been to you&rsquo;ll know what it means - that idea of a start, the chunky bit, and the gentle ending - all of it carrying you with you on well, a curve. It&rsquo;s a good concept to aim for.</p>
<p>Finally - possibly trite, but something I found to be true: <strong>The presentation will write itself.</strong> How&rsquo;s that work? Well do a version, and then leave it for a week, completely alone. When you come back to it you&rsquo;ll be fresher and some bits will be obviously superfluous or missing detail.</p>
<p><a href="/2010/04/21/my-first-presentation-help/">Here&rsquo;s a link to a previous posting</a> with some good advice on writing a presentation. One which I found particularly helpful was to remember <a href="http://twitter.com/dw_pete">Pete Scott</a>&rsquo;s advice &ndash; the audience will be on your side (hopefully!). It&rsquo;s not a sales pitch to a sceptical audience, it&rsquo;s sharing your knowledge with others who will find it interesting.</p>
