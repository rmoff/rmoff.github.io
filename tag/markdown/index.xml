      <title>Moving from Ghost to Hugo</title>

      <description>Why? I&amp;#8217;ve been blogging for quite a few years now, starting on Blogger, soon onto WordPress, and then to Ghost a couple of years ago. Blogger was fairly lame, WP yucky, but I really do like Ghost. It&amp;#8217;s simple and powerful and was perfect for my needs. My needs being, an outlet for technical content that respected formatting, worked with a markup language (Markdown), and didn&amp;#8217;t f**k things up in the way that WP often would in its WYSIWYG handling of content.</description>

      <title>Converting from AsciiDoc to MS Word</title>

      <description>Short and sweet this one. I&amp;rsquo;ve written in the past how I love Markdown but I&amp;rsquo;ve actually moved on from that and now firmly throw my hat in the AsciiDoc ring. I&amp;rsquo;ll write another post another time explaining why in more detail, but in short it&amp;rsquo;s just more powerful whilst still simple and readable without compilation.
So anyway, I use AsciiDoc (ADOC) for all my technical (and often non-technical) writing now, and from there usually dump it out to HTML which I can share with people as needed:</description>

      <title>What is Markdown, and Why is it Awesome?</title>

      <description>Markdown is a plain-text formatting syntax. It enables you write documents in plain text, readable by others in plain text, and optionally rendered into nicely formatted PDF, HTML, DOCX etc.
It&amp;rsquo;s used widely in software documentation, particularly open-source, because it enables richer formatting than plain-text alone, but without constraining authors or readers to a given software platform.
Platforms such as github natively support Markdown rendering - so you write your README etc in markdown, and when viewed on github it is automagically rendered - without you needing to actually do anything.</description>
