      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;wireless-headset-for-voip-with-no-30-minute-dalek-timebomb&#34;&gt;Wireless Headset for VOIP With No 30-Minute Dalek Timebomb&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A lot of my work is done remotely, with colleagues and customers. Five years ago I bought a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Microsoft-JUG-00014-LifeChat-LX-3000-Headset&#34;&gt;Microsoft LifeChat LX-3000&lt;/a&gt; which plugged into the USB port on my Mac. It did the job kinda fine, with two gripes:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;it wasn&amp;rsquo;t wireless. I like to wander whilst I chat, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t like being tethered. But this in itself wasn&amp;rsquo;t a reason to ditch it&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;After c.30 minutes on a call, my voice would turn into a dalek. or rather, my voice wouldn&amp;rsquo;t but the audio that others heard was.&#xA;This happened regardless of platform (Hangouts / Zoom / Skype / etc). I figured it must be a software or network issue. Never got to the bottom of it, until I switched to using a Snowball microphone for some proper &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.drilltodetail.com/podcast/2016/12/20/drill-to-detail-ep14-christmas-new-year-special-with-special-guest-robin-moffatt&#34;&gt;voice recording&lt;/a&gt; - and any calls I happened to also make on it no longer had the Dalek problem.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So I switched, on a colleague&amp;rsquo;s recommendation, to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Logitech-H600-Wireless-Headset-Mac/&#34;&gt;Logitech H600&lt;/a&gt;. I love it. The wireless works flawlessly, and no dalek effect. Gripes? Well there&amp;rsquo;s no pleasing some people. The audio quality is great for calls, but for music I switch back to my wireless &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Avantree-Comfortable-Bluetooth-Headphones-Lightweight&#34;&gt;Avantree Auditions&lt;/a&gt;. The Logitech headset also feels a bit plastic, which I don&amp;rsquo;t care about unless I&amp;rsquo;m back here in six months complaining that it&amp;rsquo;s broken&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
