      <description>Timelion was released in November 2015 and with the 4.4.2 release of Kibana is available as a native visualisation once installed. It adds some powerful capabilities to Kibana as an timeseries analysis tool, using its own data manipulation language.
Installing Timelion is a piece of cake:
./bin/kibana plugin -i kibana/timelion  After restarting Kibana, you&amp;rsquo;ll see it as an option from the application picker
There&amp;rsquo;s a bit of a learning curve with Timelion, but it&amp;rsquo;s worth it.</description>
