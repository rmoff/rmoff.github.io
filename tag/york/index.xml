      <description>I had the pleasure of not one but two fry-ups in York, UK last weekend.
The first was courtesy of Bill&amp;rsquo;s Restaurant
Overall, pretty good, and I&amp;rsquo;ve had much worse. All the ingredients seemed decent. The black pudding was overcooked and almost biscuit-like, but that&amp;rsquo;s my only serious grumble. The bacon was cooked well. That black pudding, beans and the mashed/friend potato thing were each extra charges annoyed me. Particularly with a hangover, I just want to be able to order a full english, without playing Mastermind to work out what&amp;rsquo;s in or not.</description>
