      <description>I use BigDataLite for a lot of my sandboxing work. This is a OVA provided by Oracle which can be run on VirtualBox, VMWare, etc and has the Cloudera Hadoop platform (CDH) along with all of Oracle&amp;rsquo;s Big Data goodies including Big Data Discovery and Big Data Spatial and Graph (BDSG).
Something that kept tripping me up during my work with BDSG was that HBase would become unavailable. Not being an HBase expert and simply using it as a data store for my property graph data, I wrote it off as mistakes on my part.</description>
