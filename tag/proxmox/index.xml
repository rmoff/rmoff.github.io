      <description>TL;DR When defining networking on Proxmox 4 LXC containers, use an appropriate CIDR suffix (e.g. 24) - don&amp;rsquo;t use 32!
On my Proxmox 4 server I&amp;rsquo;m running a whole load of lovely LXC containers. Unfortunately, I had trouble connecting to them. From a client machine, I got the error
ssh_exchange_identification: read: Connection reset by peer  On the server I was connecting to (which I could get a console for through the Proxmox GUI, or a session on using pct enter from the Proxmox host) I ran a SSHD process with debug to see what was happening:</description>

      <description>(Previously, previously, previously)
Since Proxmox 4 has a recent Linux kernel and mainline one at that, it means that Docker can be run on it. I&amp;rsquo;ve yet to really dig into Docker and work out when it makes sense in place of Linux Containers (LXC), so this is going to be a learning experience for me.
To install Docker, add Backports repo to apt:
root@proxmox01:~# cat /etc/apt/sources.list.d/backports.list deb http://ftp.debian.org/debian jessie-backports main  And then install:</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve got a bunch of existing VirtualBox and VMWare VMs that I want to run on Proxmox. Eventually I&amp;rsquo;ll migrate them to containers, but for the time being run them as &amp;ldquo;fat&amp;rdquo; VMs using Proxmox&amp;rsquo;s KVM virtualisation. After copying the OVA files that I had to the server, I uncompressed them:
root@proxmox01:/data04/vms/bdl44-biwa# cd ../bdl44 root@proxmox01:/data04/vms/bdl44# ll total 27249328 -rw------- 1 root root 27903306752 Jun 1 10:14 BigDataLite440.ova root@proxmox01:/data04/vms/bdl44# tar -xf BigDataLite440.</description>

With my server in place, I ran a memtest on it &amp;hellip; which with 128G took a while ;)
And then installed Proxmox 4, using a bootable USB that I&amp;rsquo;d created on my Mac from the ISO downloaded from Proxmox&amp;rsquo;s website. To create the bootable USB, create the img file:
hdiutil convert -format UDRW -o target.img source.iso  and then burn it to USB:
sudo dd if=target.img of=/dev/rdiskN bs=1m  Replace N with the correct device based on diskutil list output.</description>

      <description>After a long and painful delivery, I&amp;rsquo;m delighted to announce the arrival of a new addition to my household &amp;hellip; :
This custom-build from Scan 3XS is sat in my study quietly humming away. I&amp;rsquo;m going to use it for hosting VMs for R&amp;amp;D on OBIEE, Big Data Lite, Elastic, InfluxDB, Kafka, etc. I&amp;rsquo;ll blog various installations that I&amp;rsquo;ve done on it as a reference for myself, and anyone else interested.</description>
