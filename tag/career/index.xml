      <description>How do you try and stay current on technical affairs, given only 24 hours in a day and a job to do as well? Here&amp;rsquo;s my take on it&amp;hellip;

      <description>After 5 years at Rittman Mead, 126 blog posts, 16 conferences, four published OTN articles, an Oracle ACE award - not to mention, of course, a whole heap of interesting and challenging client work - I&amp;rsquo;ve decided that it&amp;rsquo;s time to do something different.
Later this month I&amp;rsquo;ll be joining Confluent as a Partner Technology Evangelist, helping spread the good word of Apache Kafka and the Confluent platform.
As always you can find me on Twitter @rmoff, for beer tweets, fried breakfast pics - and lots of Apache Kafka!</description>
