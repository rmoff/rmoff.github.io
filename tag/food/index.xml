      <description>One of the perks of my job is that I get to travel to some pretty nice places (hi, San Francisco, Bergen, Ã…land Islands), and get to eat some pretty good food too. If you&amp;rsquo;re looking for some techie content, then move along and go and read about Kafka, but if you enjoy food pr0n then stay put.
I was working for a client in the centre of Manchester this week, staying as usual at a Premier Inn.</description>

      <description>Thanks to the power of twitter, I can look back on all the many and varied Full English breakfasts that I&amp;rsquo;ve (mostly) enjoyed: https://twitter.com/search?q=rmoff%20%23fullenglish&amp;amp;src=typd
What makes a good Full English?
 Good ingredients, cooked well. Nothing worse than a limp pink sausage, as it were. Sausage, standard pork or Cumberland at most. Definitely no daft apricot and guava bean with a hint of foie gras nonsense. Must be cooked right well, crispy skin, almost burnt.</description>
