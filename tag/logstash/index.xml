      <description>Yesterday I wrote about Monitoring Logstash Ingest Rates with InfluxDB and Grafana, in which InfluxDB provided the data store for the ingest rate data, and Grafana the frontend.
Mark Walkom reminded me on twitter that the next release of Logstash will add more functionality in this area - and that it&amp;rsquo;ll integrate back into the Elastic stack:
@rmoff nice, LS 5.0 will have APIs exposing metrics too. theyâ€™ll be integrated back into Marvel/Monitoring!</description>

      <description>In this article I&amp;rsquo;m going to show you how to easily monitor the rate at which Logstash is ingesting data, as well as in future articles the rate at which Elasticsearch is indexing it. It&amp;rsquo;s a nice little touch to add to any project involving Logstash, and it&amp;rsquo;s easy to do.
Logstash is powerful tool for data ingest, processing, and distribution. It originated as simply the pipe to slurp at log files and put them into Elasticsearch, but has evolved into a whole bunch more.</description>

      <title>My latest IRC client : Kibana</title>

      <description>OK, maybe that&amp;rsquo;s not entirely true. But my read-only client, certainly.
I was perusing the Logstash input plugins recently when I noticed that there was one for IRC. Being a fan of IRC and a regular on the #obihackers channel, I thought this could be fun and yet another great example of how easy the Elastic stack is to work with.
Installation is a piece of cake:
wget https://download.elasticsearch.org/elasticsearch/release/org/elasticsearch/distribution/zip/elasticsearch/2.2.1/elasticsearch-2.2.1.zip wget https://download.</description>
