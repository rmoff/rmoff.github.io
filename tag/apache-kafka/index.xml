      <description>In this article I demonstrated how to use KSQL to filter streams of network event data. As well as filtering, KSQL can be used to easily enrich streams. In this article we&amp;rsquo;ll see how this enriched data can be used to drive analysis in Elasticsearch and Kibana—and how KSQL again came into use for building some stream processing as a result of the discovery made.
The data came from my home Ubiquiti router, and took two forms:</description>

      <description>Disclaimer: I am not a MongoDB person. These steps may or may not be appropriate and proper. But they worked for me :) Feel free to post in comments if I&amp;rsquo;m doing something wrong
MongoDB config - enabling replica sets For Debezium to be able to stream changes from MongoDB, Mongo needs to have replication configured:
Docs: Replication / Convert a Standalone to a Replica Set
Stop Mongo:
rmoff@proxmox01 ~&amp;gt; sudo service mongod stop Add replica set config to /etc/mongod.</description>

      <description>(This is an expanded version of the intro to an article I posted over on the Confluent blog. Here I get to be as verbose as I like ;))
My first job from university was building a datawarehouse for a retailer in the UK. Back then, it was writing COBOL jobs to load tables in DB2. We waited for all the shops to close and do their end of day system processing, and send their data back to the central mainframe.</description>

      <description>This is the detailed step-by-step if you want to recreate the process I describe in the Confluent blog here
I used Oracle&amp;rsquo;s Oracle Developer Days VM, which comes preinstalled with Oracle 12cR2. You can see the notes on how to do this here. These notes take you through installing and configuring:
Swingbench, to create a sample &amp;ldquo;Order Entry&amp;rdquo; schema and simulate events on the Oracle database Oracle GoldenGate (OGG, forthwith) and Oracle GoldenGate for Big Data (OGG-BD, forthwith) I&amp;rsquo;m using Oracle GoldenGate 12.</description>
