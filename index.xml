      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m convinced that a developer advocate &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be effective remotely. As a profession, we’ve all spent two years figuring out how to do just that. Some of it worked out great. Some of it, less so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href=&#34;https://rmoff.net/2022/04/07/hanging-up-my-boarding-passes-and-jetlagfor-now/&#34;&gt;made the decision&lt;/a&gt; during COVID to stop travelling as part of my role as a developer advocate. In this article, I talk about my experience with different areas of advocacy done remotely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sect1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;_virtual_conferences&#34;&gt;Virtual Conferences&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sectionbody&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🤢 bleugh. nah 🙈. nope 🙅.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the obvious one: do what you did before (conferences) but from home…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve &lt;a href=&#34;https://rmoff.net/2020/12/03/life-as-a-developer-advocate-nine-months-into-a-pandemic/#_virtual_conferences_as_a_speaker&#34;&gt;written&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://rmoff.net/2020/03/13/are-tech-conferences-dead/&#34;&gt;before&lt;/a&gt; about virtual conferences, so I shan’t rehash it here. Short to say, as a speaker, I’ve had my fill of talking to a faceless webcam, and I’m pretty sure as attendees most people are quite content to watch a video on YouTube at a later date than attending an online event that is almost, but not quite, entirely unlike an actual conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few managed to put on good virtual conferences. The folk over at Container Solutions hosted &lt;a href=&#34;https://rmoff.net/2020/03/13/are-tech-conferences-dead/#_software_circus&#34;&gt;Software Circus&lt;/a&gt; which was a good example of a virtual conference done well. But by and large, virtual conferences were and are a dispiriting affair for all involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sect1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;_video_youtube&#34;&gt;Video (YouTube)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sectionbody&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Just as the vacuum cleaner is known by most as a Hoover, the same for video platforms on which we disseminate material for developers. It’s YouTube, and there’s no point beating around that bush. TikTok et al are a different beast, and I’m not considering those here.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many developer advocates, &lt;a href=&#34;http://youtube.com/rmoff&#34;&gt;myself included&lt;/a&gt;, took to YouTube at the beginning of the pandemic. It was an obvious outlet - if we couldn’t be on stage, then damnit, we’d get ourselves in front of a camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My experience with YouTube started from knowing nothing about it, nothing about making videos, nada. After a while (&lt;em&gt;and with some great advice along the way from my friends and former colleagues &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/gAmUssA&#34;&gt;@gAmUssA&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/tlberglund&#34;&gt;@tlberglund&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;) I got to the point of being able to make a passingly competent amateur YouTube video. I really enjoyed it—and I reached a bunch of developers in the process!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;imageblock&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;content&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://rmoff.net/images/2022/04/2022-04-07_22-18-51.png&#34; alt=&#34;2022 04 07 22 18 51&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been one hundred and sixty five THOUSAND views of my videos, adding up to 14.2k hours (over 1.6 YEARS) watched :-) That is not to sound conceited, but to emphasise the point that if someone like me—with a face made for radio and video editing skills to match—can reach developers in that way, then any developer advocate can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another neat thing about YouTube is that it has a long tail for anything still relevant. You can see that the views per month goes up and up until the last time I published a video—but they don’t go down after that and just plateau—that is, there are still around 8 thousand views of my videos per month, even now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;imageblock&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;content&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://rmoff.net/images/2022/04/FOESNmcXEAIOGFG.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;FOESNmcXEAIOGFG&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made many of these videos months (if not years) ago, but they’re still getting thousands of views. It’s true to an extent for any content published online—but YouTube’s automagic algorithm I think must do more to boost continued traffic to it than would be got by, say, a blog sitting on a dusty corner of the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the patterns that I found most successful and rewarding as an author was to pair a blog with a video. I’d research the subject, write up a demo script, record it, and then publish all of it. That way folk who like video can watch video, and those who prefer to read and/or want to try out the code shown can also do so. I used &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/confluentinc/demo-scene/tree/master/kafka-connect-single-message-transforms&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; to host all the code samples. You can see the published results &lt;a href=&#34;https://rmoff.net/2021/02/17/ksqldb-howto-a-mini-video-series/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;imageblock&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;content&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://rmoff.net/images/2022/04/FOETklcX0AAjp-B.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;FOETklcX0AAjp B&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also learnt plenty about recording and editing video. Screenflow did the job well and its learning curve was ok for time invested. A decent camera and lighting helps too…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;imageblock&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;content&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://rmoff.net/images/2022/04/2022-04-07_22-33-17.png&#34; alt=&#34;2022 04 07 22 33 17&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can read more about my YouTube journey in &lt;a href=&#34;https://talks.rmoff.net/rgvKMl&#34;&gt;this short talk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as some developer advocates will focus on conference speaking and have their keynotes down to a T, many will focus on video nowadays. As a result, it would not be unusual to expect a developer advocate to not only be comfortable on presenting on screen, but also producing and editing such a video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sect1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;_blogging&#34;&gt;Blogging&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sectionbody&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blogging was always there for us when we were off the road, and it’s still here for us now. Whilst some developers learn through watching (like with YouTube, above), others learn through reading. A well-written blog can be the kind of material with a long, long tail. It can &lt;a href=&#34;https://rmoff.net/2018/03/06/why-do-we-need-streaming-etl/&#34;&gt;promote an idea&lt;/a&gt;, it can &lt;a href=&#34;https://rmoff.net/2021/02/26/loading-delimited-data-into-kafka-quick-dirty-but-effective/&#34;&gt;solve a specific problem&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&#34;https://rmoff.net/2019/12/18/detecting-and-analysing-ssh-attacks-with-ksqldb/&#34;&gt;illustrate a fun idea&lt;/a&gt;. I’ve &lt;a href=&#34;https://rnm1978.wordpress.com/2009/03/&#34;&gt;always loved blog writing&lt;/a&gt;, and still do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sect1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;_meeting_developers_where_they_are_online&#34;&gt;Meeting developers where they are online&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sectionbody&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re not at conferences, meetups, or customer site visits, how do you know what developers are doing? How can you advocate &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; developers and not just &lt;em&gt;to&lt;/em&gt; them? The value of a developer advocate to an organisation is not just the outbound advocacy but the inbound. The bug reports, the &amp;#34;&lt;em&gt;this damn sharp edge catches me out every time&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#34;, the &amp;#34;&lt;em&gt;I was trying to build this thing with your product&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#34; stories. If you’re face to face with developers you can’t help but have these conversations. If you’re not travelling, then you have to find that elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully in this day and age, the internet is pretty much ubiquitous amongst developers. Getting answers from StackOverflow is second nature to many. Taking to Twitter to chat and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/rmoff/status/1448230290657251338&#34;&gt;shitpost&lt;/a&gt; is standard. And amongst the shitposting and noise are golden nuggets of information. Conversations to spark up. Ideas to pursue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something I’ve done whilst at Confluent is help launch a &lt;a href=&#34;https://forum.confluent.io/&#34;&gt;Discourse-based forum&lt;/a&gt; to complement the existing Slack workspace that we have. With these two platforms I can listen to and help potentially tens of thousands of developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well as on our community platforms, I’ve had a lot of great interactions on &lt;a href=&#34;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/apache-kafka&#34;&gt;StackOverflow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/search?q=apachekafka&#34;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/apachekafka/&#34;&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt;. Find out where your communities hang out, and go &lt;strong&gt;to&lt;/strong&gt; them. A community platform that you curate and run is a nice space that’s familar and important to have, but remember that developers may not take the time to look for &lt;strong&gt;your&lt;/strong&gt; platform. General tech platforms like StackOverflow (and appropriate subreddits) are where devs also head, and if you don’t participate in those then you’re ignoring part of your audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see several concrete results and benefits from interacting with the online community:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;olist arabic&#34;&gt;
&lt;ol class=&#34;arabic&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enriching and strengthening the community by helping answer questions, model good behaviour, welcoming new users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing an online reputation as a person who is helpful and hopefully to be trusted, and not as a shill who only talks &lt;em&gt;at&lt;/em&gt; developers. When my name is subsequently seen on a blog or video I’m &lt;em&gt;that guy&lt;/em&gt; who already helped them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get ideas for blog posts and talks. Some of my most popular material started life as this. My favourite is an &lt;a href=&#34;https://talks.rmoff.net/qrgjuz/all-at-sea-with-streams-using-kafka-to-detect-patterns-in-the-behaviour-of-ships&#34;&gt;entire conference talk&lt;/a&gt; sparked by interest in a single fascinating question that someone asked on our Slack group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spot opportunity for product and documentation feedback. Sometimes this is just logging a ticket; oftentimes it’s arranging an introduction between the community member and the relevant product manager or engineer related to the issue being discussed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sect1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;_developer_experience&#34;&gt;Developer Experience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sectionbody&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team I’m part of is called &lt;code&gt;DevX&lt;/code&gt;, or Developer Experience. It broadly encompasses all the usual DevRel areas you’d expect, but its name also suggests a crucial part of what a developer advocate can provide. Just as the interface on a web app will be designed and refined by the UX (User Experience) team, a developer’s interactions with software, its APIs, and its documentation falls broadly under the &amp;#34;Developer Experience&amp;#34;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developer Advocates are well placed to be a key resource for improving developer experience, because they &lt;strong&gt;are&lt;/strong&gt; developers, and part of their job is communicating. A good developer advocate should be able to not only identify a friction point but articulate how a developer would expect it to behave, and communicate clearly how to do this. That could be an API in the software, an error message, a tutorial, or anything else that developers interface with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This in particular has been a large part of my role in recent months, with a focus on &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.confluent.io&#34;&gt;Confluent Developer&lt;/a&gt; - helping make it a resource that &lt;strong&gt;developers&lt;/strong&gt; want to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sect1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;_conferences&#34;&gt;Conferences&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sectionbody&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not speaking at them, but helping organise them. Just as a developer advocate represents the voice of the developer back to departments, including product and engineering, they can also speak well for developers when it comes to organising conferences and selecting their programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve had the honour this year of chairing the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.kafka-summit.org/events/kafka-summit-london-2022/&#34;&gt;Kafka Summit London 2022&lt;/a&gt; program committee, and it has been hugely rewarding. Being able to influence the program and help draw in talks from the community has been great, and I can’t wait for the conference itself later this month. And yes, I’ll be travelling to that :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sect1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;_building_stuff_the_devxdevrel_engineer_role&#34;&gt;Building stuff (the DevX/DevRel Engineer role)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sectionbody&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent times I’ve noticed an increase in the &lt;code&gt;Engineer&lt;/code&gt; job title in the DevRel space (&lt;code&gt;DevEx Engineer&lt;/code&gt; for example), and it usefully captures a huge part of what some DevRel folk do. Behind many brilliant talks lies some great code that enabled that demo. Supporting many a successful implementation of your product may be a library or set of hacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating demos, writing the &amp;#34;sticky tape&amp;#34; scripts and examples—these are great examples of DevRel engineering. In many cases it will be the person doing the talk that wrote the demo, that spun out script from another talk into its own github repo. But there are plenty of cases where the engineer and advocate can work collaboratively for efficiency and scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sect1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;_soare_you_saying_that_travel_is_redundant_in_developer_advocacy&#34;&gt;So…Are You Saying That Travel Is Redundant in Developer Advocacy?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sectionbody&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t be ridiculous :-P&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans crave face-to-face interactions. Virtual conferences will &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; come close to replicating that. The in-person conference will always be a thing, and developer advocates can play an important role in bringing new technologies and ideas to developers at these conferences—and feeding back conversations and ideas from them to their company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My thesis is that you don’t &lt;strong&gt;have&lt;/strong&gt; to travel. It is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; that you &lt;em&gt;shouldn’t&lt;/em&gt; travel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also on a personal level. Can I, as a developer advocate having &lt;a href=&#34;https://rmoff.net/2022/04/07/hanging-up-my-boarding-passes-and-jetlagfor-now/&#34;&gt;chosen to stop travelling&lt;/a&gt;, still be effective? Yes, I think so. Can a company’s entire DevRel efforts be done virtually as effectively as they might be with a proportion of travel involved? I would say not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sect1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;_resources&#34;&gt;Resources&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sectionbody&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;ulist&#34;&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/flyless_dev&#34;&gt;flyless.dev&lt;/a&gt; came about around the same time as the COVID lockdowns, with the premise of basically this article - as developer advocates, can we fly less? Do we really need to get on an aeroplane to go to a conference?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a really friendly community, and they have a great &lt;a href=&#34;https://discord.com/invite/FWauQ9Vj&#34;&gt;Discord server&lt;/a&gt; on which there are weekly gatherings. You can also find a few &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBKQHEoNoTJ4CxpW5shqRvA&#34;&gt;recordings of earlier meetups&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A++++ would recommend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ricardo Ferreira wrote a good article about creating &lt;a href=&#34;https://riferrei.com/how-to-create-more-effective-developer-content/&#34;&gt;effective developer content&lt;/a&gt;, which is very relevant in this context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Hanging up my Boarding Passes and Jetlag…for now</title>
      <link>https://rmoff.net/2022/04/07/hanging-up-my-boarding-passes-and-jetlagfor-now/</link>
      <pubDate>2022-04-07</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://rmoff.net/2022/04/07/hanging-up-my-boarding-passes-and-jetlagfor-now/</guid>
      <media:content xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://rmoff.net/images/2022/04/IMG_8109.jpeg" medium="image" type="image/jpg" width="100" height="100" />
      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently started writing an abstract for a conference later this year and realised that I’m not even sure if I want to do it. Not the conference—it’s a great one—but just the whole up on stage doing a talk thing. I can’t work out if this is just nerves from the amount of time off the stage, or something more fundamental to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know many Developer Advocates have been chomping at the bit to get back to proper conference speaking since COVID hit, so perhaps I’m on my own going through this kind of thought process?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weird thing is that when I get the time-hop photos of past conferences pop up on my phone, I get a proper kick of nostalgia and feel like I’ve missed it like crazy - but now I come to think about actually doing it again, I’m just not quite sure. Do I actually want to go back to what I was doing before?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then the scary thing about acknowledging that I would be doing something different is that I realise that being a Developer Advocate on stage, online, gave me an inherent sense of self-worth. I was being helpful; people liked my talks, and I was helping them. Quantifying if you’re succeeding in other roles isn’t always so easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post has been in my drafts folder for several months now, and it’s time to get it into shape and publish it. It’s a mixture of a navel-gazing diary entry and a blog about life as a developer advocate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sect1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;_some_serious_self_reflection&#34;&gt;Some serious self-reflection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sectionbody&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COVID was a bastard. It still is, albeit less so in terms of the number of people that it’s killing. But what it did give me was space to reflect on my job as a Developer Advocate, and specifically its impact on my home life. I wrote about it in depth &lt;a href=&#34;https://rmoff.net/2020/12/03/life-as-a-developer-advocate-nine-months-into-a-pandemic/&#34;&gt;previously&lt;/a&gt; and sixteen months later stand by everything I wrote, if not more so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I had to tl;dr my thoughts back then into one paragraph, it would be &lt;a href=&#34;https://rmoff.net/2020/12/03/life-as-a-developer-advocate-nine-months-into-a-pandemic/#_being_honest&#34;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;. And of that, the most crucial point then—and now—was this assertion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;quoteblock&#34;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kids are used to me travelling; it’s fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I noted when I wrote this, my kids were &lt;em&gt;used to it&lt;/em&gt;, but that is &lt;strong&gt;not to say it was fine, at all&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am truly thankful for the opportunity that not travelling afforded me to appreciate what it would mean to my relationship with my family to be at home all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I try to avoid having regrets, but I am somewhat sad to think of the years that I was around less and missed out, particularly on time with my children. &amp;#34;&lt;em&gt;You don’t get that time with them again&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#34; is an oft-repeated phrase, but it is true in every sense. The nuance that’s often missed from that expression is that it’s easy to convince oneself that since one is spending &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; time then that counts as &amp;#34;&lt;em&gt;that time&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#34;. But it doesn’t. Being around 70% of the time is a world of difference from being around 100% of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made this point &lt;a href=&#34;https://rmoff.net/2020/12/03/life-as-a-developer-advocate-nine-months-into-a-pandemic/#_the_whole_is_less_than_the_sum_of_the_parts&#34;&gt;before&lt;/a&gt;, but if you’re away 30% of the time, that doesn’t mean you simply step back in to the same remaining 70% of home life that you would do were you around all the time. Being away fundamentally alters your standing and relationship in the family. I’m not saying it changes it &lt;em&gt;negatively&lt;/em&gt; per se - but just that it alters it. You’re not the person who comes home from the office (or emerges from the home study) every evening for tea, to chat about the day, how was school, what funny toilet joke did your kids hear. You’re the person who &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; be there, who &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; be around to share a story with or who &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; instead be on the end of a FaceTime call, probably running through an airport or on a weird timezone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All families are different. All relationships are different. But I have found being off the road truly wonderful. My relationship with my children is much closer.  Life is more stable. More solid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sect1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;_so_what_now&#34;&gt;So what now?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sectionbody&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m not going to be travelling again as part of my job&lt;/strong&gt;. To be precise: I’ll travel &lt;em&gt;now and then&lt;/em&gt;, but not as a central part of my role. I’m still going to be a Developer Advocate at Confluent. I’m just going to be doing it from home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly? That’s a little bit scary. Getting on an aeroplane or train to go to a conference &lt;em&gt;was what I did for my job&lt;/em&gt;. Everything else fitted in around that. But the fundamental truth is that I want to be at home to be an integral part of my kids&amp;#39; lives growing up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do recognise that some people would &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; to be at home but &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to be on the road, and I acknowledge the privilege of my situation of being able to &lt;em&gt;choose&lt;/em&gt; not to travel. I also appreciate the willingness of my employer to support me in that choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So what now&lt;/strong&gt;? Can I even call myself a Developer Advocate once my airline status has dropped from platinum, my conference swag wardrobe has faded into threads in the wash, and I occassionally join the gibbering masses flailing around at security whilst the practised professionals tut quietly behind me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read my &lt;a href=&#34;https://rmoff.net/2022/04/07/remote-first-developer-advocacy/&#34;&gt;next post&lt;/a&gt; to see what I think that it means to be a Developer Advocate and not travel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Using GitHub Actions to build automagic Hugo previews of draft articles</title>

      <media:content xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://rmoff.net/images/2022/04/IMG_5139.jpeg" medium="image" type="image/jpg" width="100" height="100" />
      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blog is written in Asciidoc, built using Hugo, and hosted on GitHub Pages. I recently wanted to share the draft of a post I was writing with someone and ended up exporting a local preview to a PDF - not a great workflow! This blog post shows you how to create an automagic hosted preview of any draft content on Hugo using GitHub Actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is useful for previewing and sharing one’s own content, but also for making good use of GitHub as a collaborative platform - if someone &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rmoff/rmoff-blog/pull/4#pullrequestreview-933907051&#34;&gt;reviews and amends your PR&lt;/a&gt; the post gets updated in the preview too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href=&#34;https://rmoff.net/2020/12/20/scheduling-hugo-builds-on-github-pages-with-github-actions/&#34;&gt;wrote previously&lt;/a&gt; about using GitHub Actions to automagically build and deploy my blog whenever I push new content to the GitHub repo that hosts the source. My friend &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/gunnarmorling&#34;&gt;Gunnar Morling&lt;/a&gt; does not only do that with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.morling.dev/&#34;&gt;his blog&lt;/a&gt;, but he also has a neat preview functionality for new content in a Pull Request (PR). I’m writing this blog to document the steps I took to mimic &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/gunnarmorling/morling.dev/blob/master/.github/workflows/preview.yml&#34;&gt;his setup&lt;/a&gt; :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In essence it’s the same as &lt;a href=&#34;https://rmoff.net/2020/12/20/scheduling-hugo-builds-on-github-pages-with-github-actions/&#34;&gt;deploying the production Hugo site to GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt;, except it’s hosted on &lt;a href=&#34;https://surge.sh/&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;https://surge.sh/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; instead and with a variable URL (since you might have multiple drafts each with their own PR).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sect1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;_setting_up_an_account_on_surge_sh&#34;&gt;Setting up an account on surge.sh&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sectionbody&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://surge.sh/&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;https://surge.sh/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is not a shell script as the name may suggest, but a hosted service that provides &lt;code&gt;Static web publishing for Front-End Developers&lt;/code&gt;. Their audience is denoted very clearly by the fact you can’t sign up online - they assume that &lt;em&gt;of course&lt;/em&gt; you’ll have &lt;code&gt;npm&lt;/code&gt; installed (because you’re a front-end developer, right). For us heathens without it, you need to install &lt;code&gt;npm&lt;/code&gt; first which you can do via &lt;code&gt;brew&lt;/code&gt; (which in turn you can install using &lt;code&gt;npm&lt;/code&gt;…only kidding)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;listingblock&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;content&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;rouge highlight&#34; style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;&lt;code data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;brew &lt;span style=&#34;color: #0086B3&#34;&gt;install &lt;/span&gt;npm&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then install surge&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;listingblock&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;content&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;rouge highlight&#34; style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;&lt;code data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;npm &lt;span style=&#34;color: #0086B3&#34;&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #000080&#34;&gt;--global&lt;/span&gt; surge&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With it installed you can then create an account&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;listingblock&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;content&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;rouge highlight&#34; style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;&lt;code data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #008080&#34;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;surge login

   Login &lt;span style=&#34;color: #000000;font-weight: bold&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;or create surge account&lt;span style=&#34;color: #000000;font-weight: bold&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; by entering email &amp;amp; password.

          email: robin+surge@moffatt.me
       password:

   Success - Logged &lt;span style=&#34;color: #000000;font-weight: bold&#34;&gt;in &lt;/span&gt;as robin+surge@moffatt.me.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check your email and verify your email address, and then go and create an authentication token:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;listingblock&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;content&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;rouge highlight&#34; style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;&lt;code data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #008080&#34;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;surge token

   4fimxlh7xmvvs72qhmrmgbhx4jwudepa&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository&#34;&gt;Add this to your GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt; as a Repository Secret under Actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;imageblock&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;content&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://rmoff.net/images/2022/04/gha_token.png&#34; alt=&#34;gha token&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sect1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;_building_the_workflow&#34;&gt;Building the Workflow&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sectionbody&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is all built around creating a &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.github.com/en/actions&#34;&gt;GitHub Actions&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions&#34;&gt;workflow&lt;/a&gt;. It will do the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;olist arabic&#34;&gt;
&lt;ol class=&#34;arabic&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trigger when a new PR is created&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Checkout the code from the PR source branch&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Install the dependencies on the container that’s running&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set a variable to hold the target URL for the deployed preview&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Build the Hugo site&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deploy the built preview to &lt;a href=&#34;https://surge.sh/&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;https://surge.sh/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at each of these in detail. Each section contributes a lump of YAML which builds the overall workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sect2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;_triggering_a_github_action_on_a_pr&#34;&gt;Triggering a GitHub Action on a PR&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many events in a GitHub repository that can trigger an action, including a &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#pull_request&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;pull_request&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. You can refine it further using a &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#using-filters&#34;&gt;filter&lt;/a&gt;, such as only a pull request that’s been marked as ready for review. Here I’m just going to target PRs that are [re-]opened, which is the default and so &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#pull_request&#34;&gt;per the docs&lt;/a&gt; no filter is needed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;listingblock&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;content&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;rouge highlight&#34; style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;&lt;code data-lang=&#34;yaml&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #008080&#34;&gt;on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;color: #008080&#34;&gt;pull_request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sect2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;_checkout_the_code&#34;&gt;Checkout the code&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/actions/checkout&#34;&gt;This action&lt;/a&gt; checks out the code from the PR branch. It can be configured to fetch other branches if required, but per the doc:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;quoteblock&#34;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only a single commit is fetched by default, for &lt;strong&gt;the ref/SHA that triggered the workflow&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;listingblock&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;content&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;rouge highlight&#34; style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;&lt;code data-lang=&#34;yaml&#34;&gt;    &lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #008080&#34;&gt;uses&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;actions/checkout@v3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sect2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;_install_dependencies&#34;&gt;Install dependencies&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the same as used for the live site (which kinda makes sense, given that this is to be a preview of it)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;listingblock&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;content&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;rouge highlight&#34; style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;&lt;code data-lang=&#34;yaml&#34;&gt;    &lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #008080&#34;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;Install Ruby Dev&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span style=&#34;color: #008080&#34;&gt;run&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;sudo apt-get install ruby-dev&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #008080&#34;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;Install AsciiDoctor and Rouge&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #008080&#34;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;Setup Hugo&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span style=&#34;color: #008080&#34;&gt;uses&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;peaceiris/actions-hugo@v2&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span style=&#34;color: #008080&#34;&gt;with&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span style=&#34;color: #008080&#34;&gt;hugo-version&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;0.85.0&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sect2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;_determining_the_preview_url&#34;&gt;Determining the preview URL&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To deploy to &lt;code&gt;surge.sh&lt;/code&gt; I used the same GitHub Action as Gunnar, which is &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/afc163/surge-preview&#34;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;. The URL that it deploys to is determined by the source repository and PR number:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;quoteblock&#34;&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;job.name&lt;/code&gt;: This is the name of the job, specified under &lt;code&gt;jobs:&lt;/code&gt; in the YAML that defines the Workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;pr.number&lt;/code&gt;: The PR number, which can be obtained from a variable in the workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m stealing &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/gunnarmorling/morling.dev/blob/master/.github/workflows/preview.yml#L17&#34;&gt;Gunnar’s nice bit of code&lt;/a&gt; here to determine the PR number :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;listingblock&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;content&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;rouge highlight&#34; style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;&lt;code data-lang=&#34;yaml&#34;&gt;    &lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #008080&#34;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;Setup base URL env var&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span style=&#34;color: #008080&#34;&gt;run&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;export PRNUMBER=$(jq --raw-output .pull_request.number &amp;#34;$GITHUB_EVENT_PATH&amp;#34;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;echo BASEURL=&amp;#34;https://rmoff-rmoff-blog-preview-pr-&amp;#34;$PRNUMBER&amp;#34;.surge.sh/&amp;#34; &amp;gt;&amp;gt; $GITHUB_ENV&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that &lt;code&gt;export&lt;/code&gt; works locally to a step, but to pass the variable between steps you append the setting of it to &lt;code&gt;$GITHUB_ENV&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sect2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;_build_the_hugo_site&#34;&gt;Build the Hugo site&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of simply calling &lt;code&gt;hugo&lt;/code&gt; which builds the site, we add a few command line flags to build draft posts (&lt;code&gt;--buildDrafts&lt;/code&gt;), future-dated posts (&lt;code&gt;--buildFuture&lt;/code&gt;), and also change the base URL (&lt;code&gt;--baseURL&lt;/code&gt;) which by default (per the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rmoff/rmoff-blog/blob/master/config.yaml&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;config.yaml&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) is the live site (&lt;code&gt;rmoff.net&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that if the base URL is incorrectly set the resulting built site won’t render properly - you’ll get missing CSS files, weird relative links, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sect2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;_deploying_the_built_site_to_surge_sh&#34;&gt;Deploying the built site to surge.sh&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/afc163/surge-preview&#34;&gt;This action&lt;/a&gt; deploys the built site (under &lt;code&gt;/public&lt;/code&gt;, specified in the &lt;code&gt;dist&lt;/code&gt; parameter) from the previous step to surge.sh:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;imageblock&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;content&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://rmoff.net/images/2022/04/pr2.png&#34; alt=&#34;pr2&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you create the PR you’ll notice that a check has been added to it - this is the action that’s configured by the workflow and triggered by the PR being created&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;imageblock&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;content&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://rmoff.net/images/2022/04/pr2a.png&#34; alt=&#34;pr2a&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the action runs you’ll see it update the PR with its status, and then a completion message including the URL to which the preview has been uploaded&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;imageblock&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;content&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://rmoff.net/images/2022/04/pr4.png&#34; alt=&#34;pr4&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bask in the glory of a nice preview of your new article, whilst safely not impinging upon your live site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;imageblock&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;content&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://rmoff.net/images/2022/04/preview.png&#34; alt=&#34;preview&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;My thanks to &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/gunnarmorling/&#34;&gt;Gunnar Morling&lt;/a&gt; for basically figuring all this out for me to &lt;del&gt;steal&lt;/del&gt; seek inspiration from.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.myeventi.events/kafka22/gb/&#34;&gt;Kafka Summit London&lt;/a&gt; IS BACK&lt;/strong&gt;! After COVID spoiled everyone’s fun and fundamentally screwed everything up for the past two years, I cannot wait to be back at an in-person conference. At the last Kafka Summit in the beforetimes (San Francisco, 2019) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/rmoff/status/1179047181891883008&#34;&gt;some of us&lt;/a&gt; got together for a &lt;a href=&#34;https://rmoff.net/2019/09/23/kafka-summit-goldengate-bridge-run/walk/&#34;&gt;run (or walk) across the GoldenGate bridge&lt;/a&gt;. I can’t promise quite the same views, but I thought it would be fun to do something similar when we meet in London later this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;_who_what_where_when&#34;&gt;Who? What? Where? When?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sectionbody&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;ulist&#34;&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Who&lt;/em&gt;:  Anyone who would like to is very welcome :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What&lt;/em&gt;: A 5k (3.1 miles) run or walk from the conference hotel around the Greenwich Peninsula&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where&lt;/em&gt;: Starting from the conference hotel (&lt;a href=&#34;https://g.page/intercontheo2?share&#34;&gt;InterContinental London - the O2&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;Monday 25th April&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll &lt;strong&gt;meet at 07:00 BST&lt;/strong&gt; out on the riverside &lt;code&gt;Olympian Way&lt;/code&gt; path nearest to where you can reach it from the hotel. That’ll give us time to congrgate and take some &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23streamingselfie%20%23kafkasummit%20until%3A2020-03-01&amp;amp;src=typed_query&amp;amp;f=live&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;#streamingselfie&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;s if you want them, before setting off at 07:10 sharp to make our way around the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.strava.com/clubs/1039355/group_events/1146993&#34;&gt;the 5k route&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;imageblock&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;content&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://rmoff.net/images/2022/04/o2_run.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;o2 run&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go at your own pace; this isn’t a race. You can run, or walk. Or skip, if you prefer. You can &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.strava.com/clubs/1039355/group_events/1146993&#34;&gt;download the route&lt;/a&gt; to follow at your leisure. In fact, it’s a good idea to do so because this is not an organised event, so it’s your responsibility not to get lost :-D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 6min/km it’ll take half an hour to get round the 5k route. That should give you plenty of time to then take some more &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23streamingselfie%20%23kafkasummit%20until%3A2020-03-01&amp;amp;src=typed_query&amp;amp;f=live&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;#streamingselfie&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;s before heading back into the hotel for breakfast and ready for the &lt;strong&gt;start of the conference at 09:00&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sect1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;_cool_where_do_i_register&#34;&gt;Cool, where do I register?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sectionbody&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Register at &lt;code&gt;/dev/null&lt;/code&gt; ;-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an entirely unofficial, barely-organised, thing. Turn up and run, if you want. Don’t, if you don’t. Fully intend to but sleep in from the jetlag and miss it, that’s completely fine 😁&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sect1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;_other_running_options_for_other_days&#34;&gt;Other running options for other days&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sectionbody&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did toy with the idea of suggesting a run around Greenwich, but the logistics of getting there from the conference hotel and back in time with unpredictable rush hour traffic, along with quite a hill which might put some people off, made it seem the less good option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if you’re staying at the conference hotel and interested in seeing the excellent views from Greenwich observatory here are a couple of options for you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;ulist&#34;&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.strava.com/routes/2946360950897733124&#34;&gt;10k route, from the conference hotel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.strava.com/routes/2946011793818532474&#34;&gt;5k route, starting from Greenwich Park&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I might do the 10k on the Tuesday - perhaps I’ll see you there :)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>My Favourite Tools on the Mac (Setting up a new Mac)</title>

      <media:content xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://rmoff.net/images/2021/07/IMG_1108.jpeg" medium="image" type="image/jpg" width="100" height="100" />
      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the software counterpart to &lt;a href=&#34;https://rmoff.net/2020/12/02/my-workstation-2020/&#34;&gt;my previous article&lt;/a&gt; in which I looked at my workstation’s hardware setup. Some of these are unique or best-of-breed, others may have been &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.economist.com/babbage/2012/07/13/youve-been-sherlocked&#34;&gt;sherlocked&lt;/a&gt; but I stick with them anyway :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since writing the draft of this post a month ago I had to put my laptop in for repair, and in getting the loaner machine set up how I wanted it I realised that some of the tools that I originally listed below I could do without. So I’ve split the list into &lt;code&gt;essential&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;nice-to-have&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sect1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;_mac_essentials&#34;&gt;Mac Essentials&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sectionbody&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sect2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;_alfred&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.alfredapp.com/&#34;&gt;Alfred&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve used &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.alfredapp.com/&#34;&gt;Alfred&lt;/a&gt; for years, and it’s one of the first apps I’ll install on a fresh Mac. It’s like the Cmd-Space search integration that MacOS has, but &lt;strong&gt;so much more than that&lt;/strong&gt;. I started out with listing a few features here but it soon turned into a &lt;a href=&#34;https://rmoff.net/2021/07/29/why-i-use-alfred-app-and-maybe-you-should-too/&#34;&gt;love letter to Alfred&lt;/a&gt; so head there for full details :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sect2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;_moom&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://manytricks.com/moom/&#34;&gt;Moom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excellent utility for using the keyboard to move windows between desktops and resize to pre-configured places. I used to use &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.irradiatedsoftware.com/sizeup/&#34;&gt;SizeUp&lt;/a&gt;, this is like that on steroids :) It’s worth the learning curve of training muscle memory for repositioning and resizing windows, especially if you have more than one monitor. It’s probably the first tool I really missed when I got a new laptop - I was just so used to the ease with which it let me manage and manipulate windows on the desktop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sect2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;_vscode&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://code.visualstudio.com/&#34;&gt;VSCode&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My text editor of choice. Nice plugin for asciidoc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sect2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;_iterm2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://iterm2.com/&#34;&gt;iTerm2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nice Terminal replacement. Within my terminal I run &lt;code&gt;zsh&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohmyz.sh/&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;oh-my-zsh&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;code&gt;bira&lt;/code&gt; theme. Some important tools to install for a happy life in your shell:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;ulist&#34;&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;brew&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;tldr&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sect2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;_display_menu&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://displaymenu.milchimgemuesefach.de/&#34;&gt;Display Menu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great tool for quickly changing display resolution on different monitors - really handy when doing online talks etc and you want to make sure the screen resolution isn’t too tiny for sharing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sect2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;_keynote&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.apple.com/uk/keynote/&#34;&gt;Keynote&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OMG Keynote! Reason alone for getting the Mac, so that you don’t have to use Powerpoint 🤣&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know some people get somewhat evangelical about their software of choice (vi vs emacs, etc), but generally I am happy enough to use whatever’s and hand if it’s not crap. Which is why I won’t use Powerpoint ;-) This is the one thing I won’t compromise on. Keynote really is head and shoulders above Powerpoint in usability. I’m not a fan of Google Slides either, FTR. I’ll use it if I have to (in preference to Powerpoint) - but I’ll complain about it cos it’s not Keynote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sect2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;_snagit&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.techsmith.com/screen-capture.html&#34;&gt;SnagIt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very handy tool for taking and marking up static screen captures. See also &lt;a href=&#34;https://evernote.com/products/skitch&#34;&gt;Skitch&lt;/a&gt; (cheaper—free—but less functional).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sect2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;_kap&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://getkap.co/&#34;&gt;Kap&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Free tool that does a good job of video screencaptures, writing to MP4, animated GIF, etc. Does exactly what it needs to, and nothing else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For proper screencap and editing video I use &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.telestream.net/screenflow/&#34;&gt;Screenflow&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.techsmith.com/video-editor.html&#34;&gt;Camtasia&lt;/a&gt; is similar tool and equally good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sect1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;_nice_to_have_mac_tools&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Nice to have&amp;#34; Mac tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sectionbody&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are ones I’ve used for ages, but didn’t find myself rushing to install when I got a new laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sect2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;_bartender_3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.macbartender.com/&#34;&gt;Bartender 3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a while your menu bar starts to look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;imageblock&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;content&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://rmoff.net/images/2021/06/menubar.png&#34; alt=&#34;menubar&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bartender is a nice little tool for rearranging the order of the icons, or even hiding them entirely! Particularly handy when you’re presenting from your screen or recording a screencast. Plus you can customise its icon which is cool:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;imageblock&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;content&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://rmoff.net/images/2021/06/menubar2.png&#34; alt=&#34;menubar2&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sect2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;_istatmenus&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://bjango.com/mac/istatmenus/&#34;&gt;iStatMenus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CPU, memory, network, etc usage displayed on your menu bar, with hover-over drill-down visualisations. Neat!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;imageblock&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;content&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://rmoff.net/images/2021/06/istat_menus.png&#34; alt=&#34;istat menus&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sect2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;_little_snitch&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.obdev.at/products/littlesnitch/index.html&#34;&gt;Little Snitch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very powerful way to monitor, and optionally block, specific network traffic for each process on your machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s neat, but I’ve replaced it with something almost as quick - within the Mac settings you can remap the &lt;strong&gt;Fn&lt;/strong&gt; key to open the system’s emoji dialogue:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why I use Alfred App (and maybe you should too)</title>

      <media:content xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://rmoff.net/images/2021/07/IMG_1033.jpeg" medium="image" type="image/jpg" width="100" height="100" />
      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve used &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.alfredapp.com/&#34;&gt;Alfred&lt;/a&gt; for years, and it’s one of the first apps I’ll install on a fresh Mac. It’s like the Cmd-Space search integration that MacOS has, but &lt;strong&gt;so much more than that&lt;/strong&gt;. Here’s a few of the really powerful features that makes it the first app I’ll reach for to install on any new Mac - and which it’ll feel like I’m trying to work with one arm tied behind my back if I don’t have :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I wrote up a list of other &lt;a href=&#34;https://rmoff.net/2021/07/29/my-favourite-tools-on-the-mac-setting-up-a-new-mac&#34;&gt;Mac software that I use here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;ulist&#34;&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clipboard history&lt;/strong&gt;. Every time you ⌘-C what you copy goes onto the clipboard history, which you can search. So you can then paste not only the thing you just copied, but anything else you copied previously! It is &lt;strong&gt;SO&lt;/strong&gt; powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;videoblock&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;content&#34;&gt;
&lt;video src=&#34;https://rmoff.net/images/2021/06/alfred_clipboard_history.mp4&#34; autoplay=&#34;&#34; loop=&#34;&#34;&gt;

&lt;/video&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It works with &lt;strong&gt;images&lt;/strong&gt; too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;videoblock&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;content&#34;&gt;
&lt;video src=&#34;https://rmoff.net/images/2021/06/alfred_imagepaste.mp4&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; autoplay=&#34;&#34; loop=&#34;&#34;&gt;
Your browser does not support the video tag.
&lt;/video&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;File search&lt;/strong&gt;. Not just file search, but &lt;strong&gt;FILE SEARCH&lt;/strong&gt;! You can preview files, and even drag and drop them directly into an application&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;videoblock&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;content&#34;&gt;
&lt;video src=&#34;https://rmoff.net/images/2021/06/alfred_imagedrag.mp4&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; autoplay=&#34;&#34; loop=&#34;&#34;&gt;

&lt;/video&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Snippets&lt;/strong&gt;. Kinda like the clipboard history, and integrated with it too, you can predefine static or dynamic (e.g. date) text to paste into a target. Pretty handy when you don’t want to memorise the exact name of each Kafka Connect converter class ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;videoblock&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;content&#34;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spell&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Define&lt;/strong&gt;. These are invaluably and so super-easy to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;ulist&#34;&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spell:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;videoblock&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;content&#34;&gt;

&lt;/video&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Define:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;videoblock&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;content&#34;&gt;
&lt;video src=&#34;https://rmoff.net/images/2021/06/alfred_define.mp4&#34; autoplay=&#34;&#34; loop=&#34;&#34;&gt;
Your browser does not support the video tag.
&lt;/video&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Workflows&lt;/strong&gt;. I’ve only scratched the surface of these, but I can do neat stuff like pair a particular bluetooth headset and then play a noise to confirm that it’s worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;imageblock&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;content&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://rmoff.net/images/2021/06/alfred_workflow.png&#34; alt=&#34;alfred workflow&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calculator&lt;/strong&gt;. Just like spell and define, this is another useful little tool there at your fingertips. Nothing fancy, just very easy to access and use&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;videoblock&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;content&#34;&gt;
&lt;video src=&#34;https://rmoff.net/images/2021/06/alfred_calc.mp4&#34; autoplay=&#34;&#34; loop=&#34;&#34;&gt;

      <title>A bash script to deploy ksqlDB queries automagically</title>

      <media:content xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://rmoff.net/images/2021/04/IMG_9429.jpeg" medium="image" type="image/jpg" width="100" height="100" />
      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/spena/ksql/blob/7bc5875896c0206574e096c0ead808b5a87caa89/design-proposals/klip-42-schema-migrations-tool.md&#34;&gt;a bunch of improvements&lt;/a&gt; in the works for how ksqlDB handles code deployments and migrations. For now though, for deploying queries there’s the option of using &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.ksqldb.io/en/latest/operate-and-deploy/installation/server-config/#non-interactive-headless-ksqldb-usage&#34;&gt;headless mode&lt;/a&gt; (which is limited to one query file and disables subsequent interactive work on the server from a CLI), manually running commands (yuck), or using the REST endpoint to deploy queries automagically. Here’s an example of doing that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sect1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;_deploying_statements_using_ksql_endpoint&#34;&gt;Deploying statements using &lt;code&gt;/ksql&lt;/code&gt; endpoint&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this bash function defined (put it in a &lt;code&gt;.sh&lt;/code&gt; file and &lt;code&gt;source&lt;/code&gt; it) you can deploy multiple files (each with multiple statements in) thus:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use is similar to the &lt;code&gt;deploy_ksql&lt;/code&gt; function - pass it a file with SQL in to run:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;listingblock&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;content&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;rouge highlight&#34; style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;&lt;code data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;deploy_ksql ./data/ksql/03_movements/02_activations.ksql
query_ksql ./data/ksql/03_movements/03_activations_query.ksql&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that you can’t use &lt;code&gt;SET&lt;/code&gt; in the SQL passed to the endpoint. The above bash function hardcodes &lt;code&gt;&amp;#39;auto.offset.reset&amp;#39; = &amp;#39;earliest&amp;#39;&lt;/code&gt; - you can customise it as needed to set other values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sect1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;_improvements&#34;&gt;Improvements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sectionbody&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a ton to improve here. For example&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;ulist&#34;&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Checking the return code of the REST call and aborting if there’s an error condition&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;ulist&#34;&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps muting verbose output if everything’s OK&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funky characters will invariably trip up the bash code - things like quotation marks and asterisks are handled, but there’s plenty else that probably isn’t&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sect1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;_automagically_deploying_streams_and_table_to_confluent_cloud&#34;&gt;Automagically deploying streams and table to Confluent Cloud&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sectionbody&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above scripts can be tailored to work with Confluent Cloud too. Make sure you set the necessary environment variables first. See &lt;a href=&#34;https://rmoff.net/2021/03/24/connecting-to-managed-ksqldb-in-confluent-cloud-with-rest-and-ksqldb-cli/#_creating_the_ksqldb_api_key&#34;&gt;this article on how to obtain the ksqlDB API key pair&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.confluent.io/hub/streamthoughts/kafka-connect-file-pulse?utm_source=rmoff&amp;amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;amp;utm_campaign=tm.devx_ch.rmoff_csv-to-ccloud.adoc&amp;amp;utm_term=rmoff-devx&#34;&gt;FilePulse connector&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/fhussonnois&#34;&gt;Florian Hussonnois&lt;/a&gt; is a really useful connector for Kafka Connect which enables you to ingest flat files including CSV, JSON, XML, etc into Kafka. You can read more it in &lt;a href=&#34;https://streamthoughts.github.io/kafka-connect-file-pulse/docs/overview/filepulse/&#34;&gt;its overview here&lt;/a&gt;. Other connectors for ingested CSV data include &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.confluent.io/hub/jcustenborder/kafka-connect-spooldir?utm_source=rmoff&amp;amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;amp;utm_campaign=tm.devx_ch.rmoff_csv-to-ccloud.adoc&amp;amp;utm_term=rmoff-devx&#34;&gt;kafka-connect-spooldir&lt;/a&gt; (which I &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1314/2020/06/17/loading-csv-data-into-kafka/&#34;&gt;wrote about previously&lt;/a&gt;), and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.confluent.io/hub/mmolimar/kafka-connect-fs?utm_source=rmoff&amp;amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;amp;utm_campaign=tm.devx_ch.rmoff_csv-to-ccloud.adoc&amp;amp;utm_term=rmoff-devx&#34;&gt;kafka-connect-fs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here I’ll show how to use it to stream CSV data into a topic in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.confluent.io/confluent-cloud/tryfree?utm_source=rmoff&amp;amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;amp;utm_campaign=tm.devx_ch.rmoff_csv-to-ccloud.adoc&amp;amp;utm_term=rmoff-devx&#34;&gt;Confluent Cloud&lt;/a&gt;. You can apply the same config pattern to any other secured Kafka cluster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;olist arabic&#34;&gt;
&lt;ol class=&#34;arabic&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run your Kafka Connect worker. Whilst &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.confluent.io/confluent-cloud/tryfree?utm_source=rmoff&amp;amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;amp;utm_campaign=tm.devx_ch.rmoff_csv-to-ccloud.adoc&amp;amp;utm_term=rmoff-devx&#34;&gt;Confluent Cloud&lt;/a&gt; offers many different &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/connectors/index.html?utm_source=rmoff&amp;amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;amp;utm_campaign=tm.devx_ch.rmoff_csv-to-ccloud.adoc&amp;amp;utm_term=rmoff-devx&#34;&gt;managed connectors&lt;/a&gt; FilePulse isn’t yet available on it so you’ll need to &lt;a href=&#34;https://rmoff.net/2021/01/11/running-a-self-managed-kafka-connect-worker-for-confluent-cloud/&#34;&gt;run your own Kafka Connect worker connecting to Confluent Cloud&lt;/a&gt; which is what I did here&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need to &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/client-apps/topics/manage.html#create-a-topic?utm_source=rmoff&amp;amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;amp;utm_campaign=tm.devx_ch.rmoff_csv-to-ccloud.adoc&amp;amp;utm_term=rmoff-devx&#34;&gt;pre-create the topic(s)&lt;/a&gt; to which the connector is going to write, &lt;strong&gt;and also&lt;/strong&gt; the internal reporting topic that the connector uses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;listingblock&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;content&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;rouge highlight&#34; style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;&lt;code data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;ccloud kafka topic create &lt;span style=&#34;color: #000080&#34;&gt;--config&lt;/span&gt; cleanup.policy&lt;span style=&#34;color: #000000;font-weight: bold&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;compact,retention.ms&lt;span style=&#34;color: #000000;font-weight: bold&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #000080&#34;&gt;-1&lt;/span&gt;,retention.bytes&lt;span style=&#34;color: #000000;font-weight: bold&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #000080&#34;&gt;-1&lt;/span&gt; connect-file-pulse-status
ccloud kafka topic create target_csv_topic&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the connector. This has several points which are worth explaining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;ulist&#34;&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what I used to specify a given CSV filename in a given folder:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;listingblock&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;content&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;rouge highlight&#34; style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;&lt;code data-lang=&#34;javascript&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;fs.scan.filters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;           &lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;io.streamthoughts.kafka.connect.filepulse.scanner.local.filter.RegexFileListFilter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;fs.scan.directory.path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;/data/ingest/locations/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;fs.scan.interval.ms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;       &lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;10000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;file.filter.regex.pattern&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;openraildata-talk-carl-partridge-ukrail_locations.csv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The broker security config needs specifying &lt;strong&gt;in the connector&lt;/strong&gt; (not just the worker). The FilePulse connector uses its own topics to hold information about the file ingest (these are different from the topics that the Kafka Connect distributed workers use) and it needs some configuration for the producer and consumer to connect to the Kafka broker. This is prefixed with &lt;code&gt;internal.kafka.reporter&lt;/code&gt;. The two standard configuration items are easy enough and apply regardless of whether your Kafka cluster is secured:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;listingblock&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;content&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;rouge highlight&#34; style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;&lt;code data-lang=&#34;javascript&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;internal.kafka.reporter.bootstrap.servers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;internal.kafka.reporter.topic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you also need to specify the security config:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;listingblock&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;content&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;rouge highlight&#34; style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;&lt;code data-lang=&#34;javascript&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;internal.kafka.reporter.producer.security.protocol&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;internal.kafka.reporter.producer.ssl.endpoint.identification.algorithm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;internal.kafka.reporter.producer.sasl.mechanism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;internal.kafka.reporter.producer.sasl.jaas.config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;internal.kafka.reporter.consumer.security.protocol&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;internal.kafka.reporter.consumer.ssl.endpoint.identification.algorithm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;internal.kafka.reporter.consumer.sasl.mechanism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;internal.kafka.reporter.consumer.sasl.jaas.config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The connector can infer the schema of the CSV file which is neat. Do this by setting&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;listingblock&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;content&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;rouge highlight&#34; style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;&lt;code data-lang=&#34;javascript&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;filters.ParseLine.type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;             &lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;io.streamthoughts.kafka.connect.filepulse.filter.DelimitedRowFilter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;filters.ParseLine.extractColumnName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;headers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;filters.ParseLine.trimColumn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;       &lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;filters.ParseLine.separator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can specify a value from the payload to set as the message key, which is very useful. Here I’m using the field called &lt;code&gt;location_id&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;listingblock&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;content&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;rouge highlight&#34; style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;&lt;code data-lang=&#34;javascript&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;filters.setKey.type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;                &lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;io.streamthoughts.kafka.connect.filepulse.filter.AppendFilter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;filters.setKey.field&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;               &lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;$key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;filters.setKey.value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;               &lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;$value.location_id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the full connector configuration REST call. Substitute the CSV details and broker config (&lt;code&gt;CCLOUD_HOST&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;CCLOUD_API_KEY&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;CCLOUD_API_SECRET&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The connector is really powerful, and all the options can make it a bit daunting to get started with - but it’s worth persevering 😄 (and &lt;a href=&#34;https://streamthoughts.github.io/kafka-connect-file-pulse/docs/developer-guide/&#34;&gt;the documentation&lt;/a&gt; is comprehensive).&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using ksqlDB in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.confluent.io/confluent-cloud/tryfree?utm_source=rmoff&amp;amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;amp;utm_campaign=tm.devx_ch.rmoff_ksqldb-local-to-cloud&amp;amp;utm_term=rmoff-devx&#34;&gt;Confluent Cloud&lt;/a&gt; makes things a whole bunch easier because now you just get to build apps and streaming pipelines, instead of having to run and manage a bunch of infrastructure yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve got ksqlDB provisioned on Confluent Cloud you can use the web-based editor to build and run queries. You can also connect to it using the &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.ksqldb.io/en/latest/developer-guide/ksqldb-rest-api/?utm_source=rmoff&amp;amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;amp;utm_campaign=tm.devx_ch.rmoff_ksqldb-local-to-cloud&amp;amp;utm_term=rmoff-devx&#34;&gt;REST API&lt;/a&gt; and the ksqlDB CLI tool. Here’s how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sect1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;_creating_the_ksqldb_api_key&#34;&gt;Creating the ksqlDB API key&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sectionbody&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need to generate an API keypair for your ksqlDB instance (known as an application). This is a different API keypair from that which you will have for your Kafka brokers on Confluent Cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.confluent.io/ccloud-cli/current/index.html?utm_source=rmoff&amp;amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;amp;utm_campaign=tm.devx_ch.rmoff_ksqldb-local-to-cloud&amp;amp;utm_term=rmoff-devx&#34;&gt;Confluent Cloud CLI&lt;/a&gt;, first authenticate:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;listingblock&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;content&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;rouge highlight&#34; style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;&lt;code data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #008080&#34;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;ccloud login

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then list out the ksqlDB application(s) present:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make a note of the Endpoint, as well as the &lt;code&gt;Id&lt;/code&gt; of the ksqlDB application to which you want to connect. Specify the &lt;code&gt;Id&lt;/code&gt; as the value for &lt;code&gt;--resource&lt;/code&gt; in this command which will create the keypair:&lt;/p&gt;

It may take a couple of minutes &lt;span style=&#34;color: #000000;font-weight: bold&#34;&gt;for &lt;/span&gt;the API key to be ready.
Save the API key and secret. The secret is not retrievable later.

Protect this key as it allows access to your data &amp;amp; processing! Don’t do anything daft like, say, publish it in a blog on the internet 😉 &lt;em&gt;(…without revoking it first)&lt;/em&gt;

Here I’m running it as temporary container that’s deleted when it exits. I’m using the ksqlDB endpoint and authentication details saved in a  &lt;code&gt;.env&lt;/code&gt; file as shown above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ksqlDB has a rich &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.ksqldb.io/en/latest/developer-guide/ksqldb-rest-api/?utm_source=rmoff&amp;amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;amp;utm_campaign=tm.devx_ch.rmoff_ksqldb-local-to-cloud&amp;amp;utm_term=rmoff-devx&#34;&gt;REST API&lt;/a&gt; that you can use for creating and querying objects in ksqlDB. You can use it directly from a tool like &lt;code&gt;curl&lt;/code&gt;, or embedded within your own application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing to do is &amp;#39;smoke test&amp;#39; the connection and make sure you have the correct authentication details and endpoint. Here I’m using &lt;a href=&#34;https://httpie.io/&#34;&gt;HTTPie&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You also use the &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.ksqldb.io/en/latest/developer-guide/ksqldb-rest-api/ksql-endpoint/?utm_source=rmoff&amp;amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;amp;utm_campaign=tm.devx_ch.rmoff_ksqldb-local-to-cloud&amp;amp;utm_term=rmoff-devx&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;/ksql&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; endpoint to run statements which create tables and streams. This is how you can programatically deploy ksqlDB applications and pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This looks a bit grim because of all the &lt;a href=&#34;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1250079/how-to-escape-single-quotes-within-single-quoted-strings&#34;&gt;quoting&lt;/a&gt;, but the concept is still simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To query a stream you use the &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.ksqldb.io/en/latest/developer-guide/ksqldb-rest-api/streaming-endpoint/?utm_source=rmoff&amp;amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;amp;utm_campaign=tm.devx_ch.rmoff_ksqldb-local-to-cloud&amp;amp;utm_term=rmoff-devx&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;/query-stream&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; endpoint. Note that you have to use HTTP2 for this which (as far as I can tell) HTTPie does not support, so I’m showing &lt;code&gt;curl&lt;/code&gt; here. Also note that the API payload is different - &lt;code&gt;sql&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;ksql&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;properties&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;streamsProperties&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ActiveMQ source connector creates a &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.confluent.io/kafka-connect-activemq-source/current/index.html#io-confluent-connect-jms-value&#34;&gt;Struct holding the value&lt;/a&gt; of the message from ActiveMQ (as well as its &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.confluent.io/kafka-connect-activemq-source/current/index.html#io-confluent-connect-jms-key&#34;&gt;key&lt;/a&gt;). This is as would be expected. However, you can encounter &lt;em&gt;challenges&lt;/em&gt; in working with the data if the ActiveMQ data of interest within the payload is complex. Things like converters and schemas can get really funky, really quick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sect1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;_the_problem&#34;&gt;The Problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sectionbody&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my example the messages from the source system that I wanted to process in Kafka were sent to ActiveMQ as batches of messages. They were batched up in the &lt;code&gt;text&lt;/code&gt; field of the ActiveMQ payload as a JSON array. What I actually wanted to handle as individual messages like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;listingblock&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;content&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;rouge highlight&#34; style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;&lt;code data-lang=&#34;javascript&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #009999&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;Foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;colour&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;yellow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #009999&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;Bar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;colour&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;blue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Came through as a single array object like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;listingblock&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;content&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;rouge highlight&#34; style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;&lt;code data-lang=&#34;javascript&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #009999&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;Foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;colour&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;yellow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #009999&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;Bar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;colour&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;blue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The additional challenge I soon encountered was that the array was a a top-level element, rather than a named element like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;listingblock&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;content&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;rouge highlight&#34; style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;&lt;code data-lang=&#34;javascript&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;messages&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #009999&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;Foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;colour&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;yellow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #009999&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;Bar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;colour&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;blue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And all of this was then wrapped in the envelope of the ActiveMQ message:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;listingblock&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;content&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;rouge highlight&#34; style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;&lt;code data-lang=&#34;javascript&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;messageID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;42&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what to do? Well, courtesy of &lt;em&gt;lots&lt;/em&gt; of head scratching and a genius insight from my colleague Mike Bingham I came up with a solution of sorts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, use ksqlDB to manipulate the field of interest out into its own topic as a named element, and then use ksqlDB’s &lt;code&gt;EXPLODE&lt;/code&gt; function to split the array into individual messages. Read on to see the details…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sect1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;_the_answer_well_an_answer&#34;&gt;The Answer (…well, &lt;em&gt;an&lt;/em&gt; answer)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sectionbody&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serialise your data from the ActiveMQ connector using a converter that will retain the schema, because &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.confluent.io/kafka-connect-activemq-source/current/index.html#io-confluent-connect-jms-value&#34;&gt;it has one&lt;/a&gt; (the &amp;#39;envelope&amp;#39;, if you want to think of it like that). I’m using Avro:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be able to manipulate the array we need to pull it out into a named element. We do this—and discard the rest of the ActiveMQ data—writing just the JSON array with a constructed root level element (&lt;code&gt;&amp;#39;{&amp;#34;MSG_ARRAY&amp;#34;:&amp;#39; + text + &amp;#39;}&amp;#39;&lt;/code&gt;) as a primitive (i.e. no schema) back to a new Kafka topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that we use &lt;code&gt;VALUE_FORMAT=&amp;#39;KAFKA&amp;#39;&lt;/code&gt; to make sure that the raw JSON is written to the topic and not with a schema wrapped around it. The &lt;code&gt;KEY_FORMAT&lt;/code&gt; remains as Avro because it doesn’t need to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;listingblock&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;content&#34;&gt;

  &lt;span style=&#34;color: #000000;font-weight: bold&#34;&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;ROWKEY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
         &lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;{&amp;#34;MSG_ARRAY&amp;#34;:&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #000000;font-weight: bold&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #0086B3&#34;&gt;TEXT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #000000;font-weight: bold&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;}&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we have a topic with a value that looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;listingblock&#34;&gt;

      &lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;admonitionblock note&#34;&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;icon&#34;&gt;
&lt;i class=&#34;fa icon-note&#34; title=&#34;Note&#34;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;content&#34;&gt;
NOTE: The actual data is a single line of JSON, but I’ve expanded it above for readability.
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we can create a new ksqlDB stream over this data and declare a schema for the actual JSON object. For now we just declare the array and its first-level elements (we can access the rest of it later by parsing the varcar with &lt;code&gt;EXTRACTJSONFIELD&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;listingblock&#34;&gt;

        &lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;KEY_FORMAT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #000000;font-weight: bold&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;AVRO&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;VALUE_FORMAT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #000000;font-weight: bold&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;JSON&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the &lt;code&gt;ARRAY_LENGTH&lt;/code&gt; function we can check that the JSON is being handled as an array as expected:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;listingblock&#34;&gt;

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             &lt;span style=&#34;color: #000000;font-weight: bold&#34;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten messages, as expected based on the array lengths above (1 + 2 + 1 + 4 + 2)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we can actually explode the arrays of messages into individual messages on a new Kafka topic:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;listingblock&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;content&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;rouge highlight&#34; style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;&lt;code data-lang=&#34;sql&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #000000;font-weight: bold&#34;&gt;CREATE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;STREAM&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;INDIVIDUAL_MESSAGES&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #000000;font-weight: bold&#34;&gt;WITH&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;FORMAT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #000000;font-weight: bold&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #d14&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;AVRO&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #000000;font-weight: bold&#34;&gt;AS&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;color: #000000;font-weight: bold&#34;&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;ROWKEY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;EXPLODE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;MSG_ARRAY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #000000;font-weight: bold&#34;&gt;AS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;MESSAGE&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span style=&#34;color: #000000;font-weight: bold&#34;&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;PAYLOAD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the same test as above we can check the message counts grouped by key&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;listingblock&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;content&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;rouge highlight&#34; style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;&lt;code data-lang=&#34;sql&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #000000;font-weight: bold&#34;&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;ROWKEY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #000000;font-weight: bold&#34;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;MESSAGEID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
       &lt;span style=&#34;color: #000000;font-weight: bold&#34;&gt;COUNT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #000000;font-weight: bold&#34;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #000000;font-weight: bold&#34;&gt;AS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;MESSAGE_CT&lt;/span&gt;
