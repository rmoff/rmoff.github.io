      <description>&lt;p&gt;Writing is one of the most powerful forms of communication, and it’s useful in a multitude of roles and contexts. As a &lt;a href=&#34;https://rmoff.net&#34;&gt;blog-writing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/treeverse/lakeFS/pulls?q=is%3Apr+label%3Adocs+author%3Armoff+&#34;&gt;documentation-authoring&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/rmoff/status/1587382202781913089&#34;&gt;twitter-shitposting&lt;/a&gt; DevEx engineer I spend a lot of my time writing. Recently, someone paid me a very nice compliment about a blog I’d written and asked how they could learn to write like me and what resources I’d recommend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never one to miss a chance to write and share something, here’s my response to this :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To begin with I want to cover briefly the motivations behind writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-do-i-write&#34;&gt;Why Do &lt;strong&gt;I&lt;/strong&gt; Write?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, I like &lt;strong&gt;to share information&lt;/strong&gt;. That could be a new &lt;a href=&#34;https://rmoff.net/2021/03/04/quick-profiling-of-data-in-apache-kafka-using-kafkacat-and-visidata/&#34;&gt;tool&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://lakefs.io/blog/data-engineering-patterns-write-audit-publish/&#34;&gt;technique&lt;/a&gt; that I’ve learnt, &lt;a href=&#34;https://rmoff.net/2020/09/30/setting-key-value-when-piping-from-jq-to-kafkacat/&#34;&gt;a clever trick&lt;/a&gt; I’ve discovered, or sometimes away from the technical and into the realms of &lt;a href=&#34;https://rmoff.net/2019/02/09/travelling-for-work-with-kids-at-home/&#34;&gt;life pondering&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://rmoff.net/2023/05/23/what-does-this-devex-engineer-do/&#34;&gt;navel gazing&lt;/a&gt;. In the case of this very blog, it’s to share my thoughts on something that interests me. I could have written some notes and sent them directly back to the person who asked the original question, but if it was useful to them it’s hopefully useful to others—so therefore it’s worth writing up and publishing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second reason that I’ll write is &lt;strong&gt;to learn about something&lt;/strong&gt;. It’s one thing to hand-wave one’s way through a presentation. It’s another to commit pen to paper (well, bytes to disk) and &lt;a href=&#34;https://rmoff.net/2018/08/02/kafka-listeners-explained/&#34;&gt;explain something&lt;/a&gt;. Quite often I’ll realise that there’s a gap—or gaps—in my knowledge that I need to explore first before I can properly write about something, and that’s the very reason that I do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several pleasant side-effects from writing too. Anything in the public domain (such as your blog, but also open-source project documentation, etc) helps establish your credibility in an area and awareness by others of you. We may never reach the stratospheric heights of someone such as Kelsey Hightower, who has wowed a generation of developers with their &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/HlAXp0-M6SY?t=718&#34;&gt;Tetris-playing skills&lt;/a&gt;, but being known as &lt;em&gt;that guy&lt;/em&gt; who wrote a really useful blog that helped others is still a really nice feeling :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-do-i-write-for-developers&#34;&gt;HOW do I Write for Developers?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-stop-watch-this-first-&#34;&gt;🛑 STOP! Watch This First 🎥&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go and watch this excellent lecture called &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtIzMaLkCaM&#34;&gt;The Craft of Writing Effectively&lt;/a&gt;. It’s given by Larry McEnerney who is the Director of the University of Chicago’s Writing Program and knows a thing or two about writing. There are direct parallels between his observations on how and why academics communicate, and communication between developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;👉🏻 I’ve seen it recommended several times but to my embarrassment, the length put me off—but I wish it hadn’t as it’s superb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you’d rather listen instead of watch you can use &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;yt-dlp&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to download it as audio (&lt;code&gt;--extract-audio --audio-format mp3&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;so-how-do-i-write-for-developers&#34;&gt;So, how do I write for developers?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each writer will have their own approach to writing, and it will vary based on the audience and purpose too. A report for publication in an academic journey will have a different structure to a shitpost on Twitter. A blog aimed at developers will read very differently from the documentation from the depths of a product manual. Each medium and audience is valid; the knack is making sure that your writing lines up with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I write I try to write for myself—a developer, interested in a thing. That could be a new technology, an in-depth explanation, a random musing on life, or anything else. Would I like to read the thing I’ve read? Does it avoid the pitfalls that plague the soulless bland crap that some companies churn out, stick an emoji on, and call developer marketing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three key dimensions that it’s useful to consider here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;clarity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;personality (also called voice)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;uniformity of content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can roughly overlay these dimensions across the range of written materials that we might write:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://rmoff.net/images/2023/07/01.svg&#34; width=600/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things aren’t always so simple, and for some platforms in particular there’s quite a range:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://rmoff.net/images/2023/07/02.svg&#34; width=600/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do these different dimensions mean in practice? Let’s explore that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;clarity-is-key&#34;&gt;Clarity is Key&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first of these dimensions is pretty straightforward and shouldn’t really vary. Whatever you write, for whomever you write it, &lt;strong&gt;it has to be clear&lt;/strong&gt;. Writing clearly means everything from sentence construction and paragraph breaks through to the structure of your article. It can be surprisingly hard to do but is crucial if you want to write material that people will &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One neat trick when it comes to clarity is to remember that &lt;em&gt;what you leave out&lt;/em&gt; is as important as what you leave in. This is going to be very context-specific. Documentation, by definition, should be comprehensive. A blog, on the other hand, might want to get to the point sooner and just provide a link to background material for the reader should they want it. Less is often more, as they say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some types of writing are going to have greater scope for individuality than others, but all have the potential to at least be accessible and clear. For example, just because you’re writing documentation doesn’t give you a pass to copy and paste the requirements doc in all its generic and obscure complexity. Write documentation that you as a developer would like to read. It can be complex and precise, yet still accessible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;personality-and-voice&#34;&gt;Personality and Voice&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should the &amp;lsquo;voice&amp;rsquo; of the author be allowed to come through in the writing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is very much a sliding scale. I’ve jotted down &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; of the characteristics you might associate with either extreme of the scale. This is not to say that by definition you’d put cuss words into a blog so as to convey your voice—but as an example of something that you might see at that end of the spectrum and definitely not at the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://rmoff.net/images/2023/07/03.svg&#34; height=300/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How you decide where to pitch your voice on this scale will come down to your preference, audience, and general area and discipline. If you spend much time on Twitter you’ll notice that InfoSec Twitter is different from DevOps Twitter, which is different again from DataEng Twitter. Each has its own cliques and customs, and also a varying range to which an author’s voice shines through in published writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll generally find that generally writing mediums such as a project report to stakeholders or product documentation requires a neutral voice. That’s not to say &lt;em&gt;boring&lt;/em&gt;, but it is to say that a certain uniformity is required. In the case of a project report, the message mustn’t be obscured by colloquialisms and the such. And can you imagine the cognitive dissonance if a set of documentation were written by multiple writers each looking to stamp their personality on the pages?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we get to things like blogs and other types of writing we &lt;em&gt;deliberately&lt;/em&gt; want to include some personality. How much is up to you to calibrate with your audience and yourself. There is a “Goldilocks” zone here—enough personality and genuine voice coming through to convince the reader that they are reading something that was written by someone who is actually interested and informed on the matter, but not so much that it gets in the way of the content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;uniformity-and-standardisation&#34;&gt;Uniformity and Standardisation&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has a strong relationship with personality and voice but relates a lot more to the structure and content of the material&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://rmoff.net/images/2023/07/04.svg&#34; height=300/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the example of blogs, you’ll find that blogs for a company or project are going to have a strong focus on the consistency of messaging and structure. There’ll be an introduction, there’ll be context; it’ll be comprehensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compare that to a personal blog that may sometimes be not much more than the gutterings of a developer wanting to log an error message and solution for future Googlers. They &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; flesh it out into a longer article, but that’s not necessary for it still to have value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;a-holistic-view&#34;&gt;A Holistic View&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may seem like there’s going to be a linear relationship between the two dimensions. As we decrease the amount of personality coming through in an author’s writings, we’re also going to move towards a much more standardised set of writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d suggest that it’s not always the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A startup may value personality much more over standardisation, perhaps only really dropping the voice when it comes to something like documentation (and even then, perhaps not entirely).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://rmoff.net/images/2023/07/05.svg&#34; height=300/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the other end of the scale, some companies—usually large corporations—have the habit of squeezing the last inch of life out of any kind of writing, making the relationship a much different one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here there’s little voice even where you might hope to find it, and that rapidly drops off into nothing very soon after:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://rmoff.net/images/2023/07/06.svg&#34; height=300/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wildcard within this is the social media teams of large companies who &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; given the remit to be &lt;code&gt;Funny&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Engaging&lt;/code&gt;, but this is usually outside the scope of developer writing and more into the field of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.boredpanda.com/sassiest-responses-from-companies&#34;&gt;condiments and fast food chains&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;structuring-your-blog-writing&#34;&gt;Structuring your Blog Writing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like a favourite pair of jeans that’s well-worn, comfy, and slightly saggy round the arse, I have a go-to structure for writing. Come to think of it, I use it for lots of conference talks too. It looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tell them what you’re going to tell them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tell them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tell them what you told them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this looks like in practice is something along these lines:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An intro&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is this thing, and why should the reader &lt;del&gt;give af&lt;/del&gt; be interested?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This could be a brief explanation of why I am interested in it, or why you would want to read my take on it. The key thing is you’re relating to your audience here. Not everyone wants to read everything you write, and that’s ok.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let people self-select out (or in, hopefully) at this stage, but make it nice and easy. For example, if you’re writing about data engineering, make it clear to the appdev crowd that they should move on as there’s nothing to see here (or stick around and learn something new, but as a visitor, not the target audience).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The article itself&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A recap&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure you don’t just finish your article with a figurative mic drop—tie up it nicely with a bow (a 🙇🏻 or a 🎀, either works).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where marketing would like to introduce you to the acronym CTA (Call To Action) 😉. As an author you can decide how or if to weave that into your narrative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either way, you’re going to summarise what you just did and give people something to &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; with it next. Are there code samples they can go and run or inspect? A new service to sign up for? A video to watch? Or just a general life reflection upon which to ponder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;-the-physical-act-of-writing-jfdi--&#34;&gt;✍🏻 The Physical Act of Writing: JFDI ;-)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://rmoff.net/images/2023/07/07.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the risk of repeating the &lt;a href=&#34;https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/how-to-draw-an-owl&#34;&gt;owl meme&lt;/a&gt; I would give the following advice: just start writing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t mean just go write an article. I mean start writing &lt;strong&gt;something&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;anything.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some notes, some snippets, some whole paragraphs. It might even look like this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://rmoff.net/images/2023/07/08.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point is you now have &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;. The sections and threads of a story start to fall out as you write more. What starts as one section perhaps becomes two as you realise there are individual elements to tease out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iterate, iterate, and then iterate some more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That random link you made a note of, where does it fit in what you want to say? Is it pushing the need for a new section or tangent, or is it actually not so relevant and you can park it? Not sure? Well just leave it there and think about it again on the next pass round.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve recently found that using a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique&#34;&gt;Pomodoro timer&lt;/a&gt; is an effective way of getting me to focus, and to take a break. Instead of staring at a screen, descending into a pit of despair at the stagnation of an article, you spend a chunk of time and then step away. Perhaps you come back to it after the break or maybe wait longer. Like many problems in life, things resolve themselves given time to marinade in the recesses of one’s brain. That paragraph that just wouldn’t write itself will come spilling out of your eager fingers onto the keyboard. The section you thought you’d &lt;em&gt;nailed&lt;/em&gt;—turns out you didn’t and it needs a rewrite. But all these things come with time and iteration through the text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;find-a-really-good-reviewer-and-copyeditor&#34;&gt;Find a really good reviewer and copyeditor&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might think you’re good at writing. You’re probably not &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; good at writing that the eye of an excellent copyeditor won’t improve it, nor the tactful input of a good reviewer enhance it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good copyeditors will respect the voice that’s present in your writing and work to preserve it whilst improving the clarity and grammatical accuracy of what you’ve written.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good reviewers will grok what you’re saying and help distil and mould it into a better shape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;tools&#34;&gt;Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah, the meta-blog post about tooling. Each to their own, but here’s my stack:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://obsidian.md/&#34;&gt;Obsidian&lt;/a&gt; for authoring&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cleanshot.com/&#34;&gt;CleanShot X&lt;/a&gt; for screen grabs and markup&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.grammarly.com/&#34;&gt;Grammarly&lt;/a&gt; for proofreading (and please, for the sak of your readers, profread, noone wnats to red a baydly writen blog)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://rmoff.net/categories/hugo/&#34;&gt;Hugo and GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt; for publishing and hosting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;resources&#34;&gt;Resources&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;📧 An email-based course called &lt;a href=&#34;https://bloggingfordevs.com/&#34;&gt;Blogging for Devs&lt;/a&gt;. It’s quite focussed on the mechanics of a blogging but has some useful nuggets - and it’s free&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;A nice blog from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/kudmitry/&#34;&gt;Dmitry Kudryavtsev&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.yieldcode.blog/post/why-engineers-should-write&#34;&gt;Why engineers should focus on writing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;footnote-_what_-should-i-write&#34;&gt;Footnote: &lt;em&gt;What&lt;/em&gt; Should I Write?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We’ve covered the why and the how - but what about the what?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What to write will often come from the “Why” above, but let’s imagine that the creative juices aren’t flowing and you still really want to get a blog written.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A really excellent place for ideas is the community around the thing you want to write about. Go and lurk (or even better, join in) at StackOverflow, Twitter, Slack, Discord…wherever the community is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What questions do people repeatedly ask?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the anti-patterns and misunderstandings that you see?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the new trends?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What cool things can you do with &lt;code&gt;$THING&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, if it would be interesting to me then I would write about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure to also watch &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtIzMaLkCaM&#34;&gt;this lecture&lt;/a&gt; in which the concept of &lt;em&gt;value&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;ideas&lt;/em&gt; is discussed. tl;dr if you aren’t writing about something interesting to the reader, it has no value, regardless of its value to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-not-to-write&#34;&gt;What Not to Write?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; personal preference. I’m not keen at all on growth-driven blogging styles. You know the sort: listicles, SEO bait, etc. It’s low-grade, developers see through it, and it tarnishes the blogger’s image IMHO. That said, if you write a good blog, there’s no reason not to structure it such (“&lt;em&gt;Top Five Tips for Successful Developer Writing&lt;/em&gt;”) but put the horse before the cart, not the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;recap&#34;&gt;Recap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To summarise this whole article, bear in mind that these two statements are not mutually exclusive:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write for yourself. Work out what &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; would like to read, and write it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Think of the reader and what value you’re providing to them in your writing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s because as a developer writing for developers, you &lt;strong&gt;are&lt;/strong&gt; the reader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and did you watch &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtIzMaLkCaM&#34;&gt;Larry McEnerney’s lecture&lt;/a&gt; yet? 😊&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What Does This DevEx Engineer Do?</title>

      <pubDate>2023-05-23</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://rmoff.net/2023/05/23/what-does-this-devex-engineer-do/</guid>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This was originally titled more broadly &amp;ldquo;What Does &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; DevEx Engineer Do&amp;rdquo;, but that made it into a far too tedious and long-winding etymological exploration of the discipline. Instead, I&amp;rsquo;m going to tell you what this particular instantiation of the entity does 😄&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;lets-define-devex-first&#34;&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s Define DevEx first…&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developer Experience (a.k.a. DevEx, DevX) is fundamentally about making the experience for developers a good, nay, positively joyful, one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s about removing the &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;if you just read the first five chapters of the manual then you can use this … calculator&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; and instead making software behave as one would instinctively expect it to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s pre-populating fields that can be pre-populated, opening APIs that can be opened, removing barriers and lifting developers up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s about shipping that MVP but with the sharp edges rounded off and plotting a happy path for users so that the cringe-worthy mission statement of companies that &amp;ldquo;we build software that people love&amp;rdquo; can actually seem credible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a crowded market-place where alternative software is a click away making your software not just functional but also damned easy and enjoyable to use is vital. Developers are no longer chained to their workstations, doomed to use whatever piece of crap the IT director bought on the golf course from some salesman looking to hit their quarterly target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developers are empowered to use the software that not only works but which gets the job done efficiently, painlessly, and is easy to use. Don&amp;rsquo;t confuse &lt;em&gt;easy&lt;/em&gt; with &lt;em&gt;simple&lt;/em&gt;—complicated software can have a great developer experience - and simple software can unfortuntely also have a bloody awful developer experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;but-hang-on-i-thought-devex-was-differentthing&#34;&gt;But Hang On, I thought DevEx Was… &lt;code&gt;$DifferentThing&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developer Experience (DevEx, also DevX) has taken on a similar-but-dual meaning in the last year or two. Both relate to developers and their experience, but one&amp;rsquo;s audience is developers &lt;em&gt;within&lt;/em&gt; a company, and the other&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;outside&lt;/em&gt; the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My familiarity with DevEx is based on the latter - working to improve the experience of developers external to the company, and specifically, those to whom the company is building and hopefully selling a product. Just like the broader discipline of Developer Relations as a whole—of which this version of DevEx is a part—there is no selling to be done here. DevRel, DevEx, and whatever other term you come up with, do not sell. Period. They educate, inform, and entertain the developer base, with a view to the developer then having such a great time with the software that they subsequently decide to open their cheque books and buy the software of their own volition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other DevEx which I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed more and more of recently is that serving the developers within a company. A good example of this angle is the wonderfully-named &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.container-solutions.com/wtf-is-devex&#34;&gt;WTF is DevEx&lt;/a&gt; from Container Solutions. Microsoft have &lt;a href=&#34;https://microsoft.github.io/code-with-engineering-playbook/developer-experience/&#34;&gt;a good page on DevEx&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.developerexperience.us/&#34;&gt;DevX Community&lt;/a&gt; has sprung up to provide a place for DevX practitioners to support each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ok-so-were-talking-about-the-devrel-y-devex&#34;&gt;OK, so we&amp;rsquo;re talking about the DevRel-y DevEx&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both kinds of DevX are important, and there is &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; overlap between them - but there are some significant differences. DevX done under the DevRel banner will often include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Content creation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Documentation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Community interaction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a nutshell, it&amp;rsquo;s activities that enhance the &lt;em&gt;experience&lt;/em&gt; of a &lt;em&gt;developer&lt;/em&gt; not only when they&amp;rsquo;re just using software, but on their entire journey with it - from becoming aware of it, trying it, learning it, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;so-what-does-this-devex-engineer-do&#34;&gt;So… What Does &lt;em&gt;This&lt;/em&gt; DevEx Engineer Do?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;isnt-this-the-same-as-developer-advocacy&#34;&gt;Isn&amp;rsquo;t this the same as Developer Advocacy?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To an extent, yes. I&amp;rsquo;m not interested in a discussion about job titles really, short to say that most people assume a Developer Advocate travels and does conference talks with other activities fitting around it. For me a DevX Engineer is more focussed on the building and writing, than speaking.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Authoring Wordpress blogs in Markdown (with Google Docs for review)</title>
      <link>https://rmoff.net/2023/05/03/authoring-wordpress-blogs-in-markdown-with-google-docs-for-review/</link>
      <pubDate>2023-05-03</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://rmoff.net/2023/05/03/authoring-wordpress-blogs-in-markdown-with-google-docs-for-review/</guid>
      <media:content xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://rmoff.net/images/2023/05/t_IMG_2565.jpeg" medium="image" type="image/jpg" width="100" height="100" />
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Wordpress still, to an extent, rules the blogging world. Its longevity is testament to…something about it ;) However, it&amp;rsquo;s not my favourite platform in which to write a blog by a long way. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t support Markdown to the extent that I want. Yes, I&amp;rsquo;ve tried the plugins; no, they didn&amp;rsquo;t do what I needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like to write all my content in a structured format - ideally &lt;a href=&#34;https://asciidoc.org/&#34;&gt;Asciidoc&lt;/a&gt;, but &lt;a href=&#34;https://rmoff.net/2017/09/12/what-is-markdown-and-why-is-it-awesome/&#34;&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll settle for Markdown too&lt;/a&gt;. Here&amp;rsquo;s how I stayed [almost] sane whilst composing a blog in Markdown, reviewing it in Google Docs, and then publishing it in Wordpress in a non-lossy way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;author&#34;&gt;Author&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write your blog in Markdown. &lt;em&gt;Perhaps this approach will work with Asciidoc too, since pandoc also works with it - I&amp;rsquo;ve just not tried it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;review&#34;&gt;Review&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Docs is still the best way that I&amp;rsquo;ve found to collaboratively review a blog. It&amp;rsquo;s accessible to technical and less-technical users alike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ll get your Markdown into GDocs via a &lt;code&gt;.docx&lt;/code&gt; export/import.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;pandoc&lt;/code&gt; to convert the Markdown to &lt;code&gt;.docx&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;pandoc Securing&lt;span style=&#34;color:#b62;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;\ &lt;/span&gt;lakeFS&lt;span style=&#34;color:#b62;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;\ &lt;/span&gt;with&lt;span style=&#34;color:#b62;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;\ &lt;/span&gt;Role-Based&lt;span style=&#34;color:#b62;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;\ &lt;/span&gt;Access&lt;span style=&#34;color:#b62;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;\ &lt;/span&gt;Control&lt;span style=&#34;color:#b62;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;\ \(&lt;/span&gt;RBAC&lt;span style=&#34;color:#b62;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;\)&lt;/span&gt;.md &lt;span style=&#34;color:#b62;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;\
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#b62;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;       -o ~/Downloads/blog.docx   
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Import the &lt;code&gt;.docx&lt;/code&gt; file to Google Docs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Save GDoc as native Google Doc, share with comment access&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Review / Copyedit&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make edits, accept proposed changes, etc directly in GDocs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re using Asciidoc, see this related blog that I wrote on &lt;a href=&#34;https://rmoff.net/2020/04/16/converting-from-asciidoc-to-google-docs-and-ms-word/&#34;&gt;Converting from AsciiDoc to Google Docs and MS Word&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;publish&#34;&gt;Publish&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point the Google Doc is ready to publish. However, Google Docs doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a concept of code blocks (and other formatting such as figure captions) that your Markdown has. We don&amp;rsquo;t want lose these in a straightforward copy and paste into Wordpress&amp;rsquo; WYSIWYG editor directly&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://rmoff.net/images/2023/05/1.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;import-the-changed-gdoc-with-edits-back-into-markdown&#34;&gt;Import the changed GDoc with edits back into Markdown&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Export the copy edited &amp;amp; reviewed &lt;a href=&#34;https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/docs_to_markdown/700168918607?ref=iain-broome&#34;&gt;GDoc back to Markdown using a Chrome plugin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do a diff and import changes back to original Markdown document (so that code blocks &amp;amp; language are not lost)
&lt;img src=&#34;https://rmoff.net/images/2023/05/CleanShot%202023-03-17%20at%2006.39.02@2x.png&#34; alt=&#34;|700&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;publish-the-markdown-to-wordpress&#34;&gt;Publish the Markdown to Wordpress&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Convert the markdown to HTML.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;cd &amp;#34;/Users/rmoff/my_blogs/&amp;#34;
pandoc &amp;#34;Here&amp;#39;s Something Diff-erent - lakeFS adds support for diff of Delta tables.md&amp;#34; \
    -o ~/Downloads/blog.html \
    --wrap=none \
    --no-highlight \
    --extract-media=/Users/rmoff/Downloads/
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;--no-highlight&lt;/code&gt; is important to stop the HTML being generated with syntax highlighting - we want to keep the pure code block intact and let WP doing its highlighting instead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;extract-media&lt;/code&gt; path does not support &lt;code&gt;~&lt;/code&gt; and a relative path is from the working directory in which the command is executed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Wordpress, create a new post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the top-right dropdown menu select &lt;strong&gt;Code editor&lt;/strong&gt; (⇧⌥⌘M) to view the raw HTML. Copy and paste the HTML that pandoc generated into Wordpress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://rmoff.net/images/2023/05/Pasted%20image%2020230317104543.png&#34; alt=&#34;|300&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upload all the images needed to the WordPress Media Library. Look at the resulting URL prefix (e.g. &lt;code&gt;https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/&lt;/code&gt;) and search and replace all the image paths in the source HTML as needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will need to amend &lt;code&gt;%20&lt;/code&gt; in the URL for &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt; for files with spaces in&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point the code should render OK, but without syntax highlighting&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://rmoff.net/images/2023/05/Pasted%20image%2020230317105230.png&#34; alt=&#34;|500&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To add in the syntax highlighting:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Search and replace in the raw HTML to replace:  &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;pre class=&amp;quot;bash&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;pre class=&amp;quot;bash&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;code lang=&amp;quot;bash&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;language-bash&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. You can do this in your favourite text editor, or use this little bash snippet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;sed -i &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ba2121&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;.bak&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#b62;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;\
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#b62;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ba2121&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;s/&amp;lt;pre class=&amp;#34;\(.*\)&amp;#34;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;/&amp;lt;pre class=&amp;#34;\1&amp;#34;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;code lang=&amp;#34;\1&amp;#34; class=&amp;#34;language-\1&amp;#34;&amp;gt;/&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#b62;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;\
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#b62;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;    ~/Downloads/blog.html
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copy and paste the HTML into the blog&amp;rsquo;s code editor afresh&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use this one weird trick…&lt;/strong&gt; switch back to the visual editor, put the cursor in the editor box, and click the &lt;strong&gt;Convert to blocks&lt;/strong&gt; option that appears&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://rmoff.net/images/2023/05/CleanShot%202023-03-17%20at%2011.01.58@2x.png&#34; alt=&#34;|400&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you click in one of the code blocks you&amp;rsquo;ll see that it&amp;rsquo;s picked up the language, and when you preview the blog it should highlight its syntax correctly
&lt;img src=&#34;https://rmoff.net/images/2023/05/CleanShot%202023-03-17%20at%2011.04.18@2x.png&#34; alt=&#34;|400&#34;&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Building Better Docs - Automating Jekyll Builds and Link Checking for PRs</title>

      <media:content xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://rmoff.net/images/2023/04/t_IMG_9850.jpeg" medium="image" type="image/jpg" width="100" height="100" />
      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the most important ways that a project can help its developers is providing them good documentation. Actually, scratch that. &lt;em&gt;Great&lt;/em&gt; documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://rmoff.net/images/2023/04/Pasted%20image%2020230419164830.png&#34; alt=&#34;Kathy Sierra - If you want them to RTFM, make a better FM&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.lakefs.io/&#34;&gt;lakeFS documentation&lt;/a&gt; is built as a static site using &lt;a href=&#34;https://jekyllrb.com/&#34;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs/&#34;&gt;Just the Docs&lt;/a&gt; theme, hosted on &lt;a href=&#34;https://pages.github.com/&#34;&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt;. The documentation itself is stored on GitHub, and &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; changes to it go through a PR review process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were two points of friction that I wanted to fix to make it easily and quicker to improve the docs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The local build process for docs was not instantaneous, meaning that &lt;em&gt;contributors&lt;/em&gt; would either just not test their changes (&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;it&amp;rsquo;s just a small docs change&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;, amiright?), or would diligently test them and wasting literally minutes between each build (if you&amp;rsquo;ve any tips to fix this &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/treeverse/lakeFS/issues/5404&#34;&gt;let me know&lt;/a&gt;!). On top of this, reviewers of PRs would need to clone the repo and build the docs site to be able to review the changes properly…so very tedious&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://rmoff.net/images/2023/04/zzzzzzz-gif.gif&#34; alt=&#34;BORING&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were broken links, and no automated checking on incoming Pull Requests (PRs) that a change didn&amp;rsquo;t break things further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;github-actions-are-magic&#34;&gt;GitHub Actions are MAGIC&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re already using GitHub PRs then using &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.github.com/en/actions&#34;&gt;Actions&lt;/a&gt; fits in with the workflow beautifully. Actions are defined per-repository and can be triggered by, amongst other things, a new PR. Actions can do lots of things including building and testing your code itself. The two actions I set up do the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build the docs site from the code in the PR, and deploy it as a static site hosted temporarily on surge.sh&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run a link checker on the whole site, and if broken links are found fail the job ❌ and log the problems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see the action definition &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/treeverse/lakeFS/blob/master/.github/workflows/docs-pr.yaml&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; - feel free to take it and customise it for your own use! Below I explain a bit more about how each works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;triggering-the-action&#34;&gt;Triggering the Action&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The action is triggered by any PR to &lt;code&gt;master&lt;/code&gt; branch and touching files under &lt;code&gt;/docs&lt;/code&gt; (there&amp;rsquo;s no point rebuilding the docs site if it&amp;rsquo;s only code in the repo that changed and not docs)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-yaml&#34; data-lang=&#34;yaml&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#008000;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;on&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#008000;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;pull_request&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#008000;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;paths&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt;      &lt;/span&gt;- &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ba2121&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;docs/**&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#008000;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;branches&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt;      &lt;/span&gt;- master&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;build-the-docs-site&#34;&gt;Build the docs site&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The action runs as a single job covering both purposes (preview deploy, and link checker). I guess it could be split and the build run twice. The job is executed on a container (defined in the &lt;code&gt;runs-on: ubuntu-20.04&lt;/code&gt; step) that lives for the duration of the job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The build itself is just as it is in the live docs deployment, running Jekyll&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;build&lt;/code&gt; command against the &lt;code&gt;docs&lt;/code&gt; folder of the repo and writing the static site to a &lt;code&gt;_site&lt;/code&gt; path on the container.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-yaml&#34; data-lang=&#34;yaml&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;- &lt;span style=&#34;color:#008000;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Build latest&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt;	&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#008000;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;build-latest&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt;	&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#008000;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;working-directory&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;docs&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt;	&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#008000;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;run&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;bundle exec jekyll build --config _config.yml -d _site/ --verbose&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;deploy-a-preview-of-docs-changes&#34;&gt;Deploy a Preview of Docs Changes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before deploying the preview the action some shell script which overlays on each page of the docs site a label to show that it&amp;rsquo;s a preview build, and linking back to the PR from which it was generated:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://rmoff.net/images/2023/04/CleanShot_2023-04-19_at_17.47.05.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish I could claim credit for the code, but it was all the handiwork of chatGPT (pretty cool, right!). This updates the HTML files in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-yaml&#34; data-lang=&#34;yaml&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;- &lt;span style=&#34;color:#008000;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Overlay PR message on each page&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt;	&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#008000;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;working-directory&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;docs/_site&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt;	&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#008000;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;run&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;|&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt;	  &lt;/span&gt;PR_URL=${{ github.event.pull_request.html_url }}&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt;	  &lt;/span&gt;PR_NUMBER=${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt;	  &lt;/span&gt;html_files=$(find . -name &amp;#39;*.html&amp;#39;)&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt;	  &lt;/span&gt;for file in $html_files; do&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt;		&lt;/span&gt;sed -i -e &amp;#34;s|\(.*\)\(&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;\)|&amp;lt;div style=\&amp;#34;position: fixed; top: 5px; left: 5px; padding: 3px; background-color:&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#408080;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;#e8ac07; font-weight: bold; z-index: 9999; box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.5);\&amp;#34;&amp;gt;ℹ️ This is a preview of PR &amp;lt;a href=\&amp;#34;$PR_URL\&amp;#34; style=\&amp;#34;color: black;\&amp;#34;&amp;gt;#$PR_NUMBER&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;\n\1\2|&amp;#34; $file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt;	  &lt;/span&gt;done&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next step then uses a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/afc163/surge-preview&#34;&gt;pre-built Action&lt;/a&gt; to deploy a given folder to &lt;a href=&#34;https://surge.sh/&#34;&gt;surge.sh&lt;/a&gt; (a static site hosting service which provides a free plan that&amp;rsquo;s perfect for this use). You can read more about setting up surge.sh &lt;a href=&#34;https://rmoff.net/2022/04/06/using-github-actions-to-build-automagic-hugo-previews-of-draft-articles/#_setting_up_an_account_on_surge_sh&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The action also updates the PR itself with the link to the preview, so the submitter and reviewer both can easily see the impact of the PR on the docs site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://rmoff.net/images/2023/04/CleanShot_2023-04-19_at_17.51.29.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;checking-for-broken-links&#34;&gt;Checking for Broken Links&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This requires a single step in the job to invoke the link checking tool &lt;a href=&#34;https://lychee.cli.rs/&#34;&gt;lychee&lt;/a&gt; using the supplied &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/lycheeverse/lychee-action&#34;&gt;GitHub Action&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The root of the built docs site (&lt;code&gt;docs/_site&lt;/code&gt; ) is supplied as the first argument, along with an exclusion file of pages and URLs to not check. I added to this things like URLs in the documentation that referred to sample instances of the lakeFS server (e.g. http://127.0.0.1:8000 is indeed a link, but not a link that we want to check because it&amp;rsquo;s not going to be valid). Some other external sites also needed adding to the ignore file as they appeared to block the automated checking and caused false positives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-yaml&#34; data-lang=&#34;yaml&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;- &lt;span style=&#34;color:#008000;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Check links&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt;	&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#008000;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;lychee&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt;	&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#008000;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;uses&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;lycheeverse/lychee-action@v1.6.1&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt;	&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#008000;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;with&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt;	  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#008000;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;docs/_site --no-progress --exclude-file=docs/.lycheeignore&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt;	  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#008000;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;fail&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#008000;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt;	  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#008000;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;jobSummary&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#008000;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt;	  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#008000;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;markdown&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt;	&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#008000;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;env&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt;	  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#008000;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;GITHUB_TOKEN&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;${{secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN}}&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If any broken links are found the Action logs these in a very readable and useful way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://rmoff.net/images/2023/04/CleanShot_2023-04-19_at_17.58.16.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;go-and-try-it-out&#34;&gt;Go and try it out&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GitHub Action configuration that I used is &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/treeverse/lakeFS/blob/master/.github/workflows/docs-pr.yaml&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Give it a try, and let me know any other cool tricks you have for keeping documentation in tip-top shape :)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;No great insights in this post, just something for folk who Google this error after me and don&amp;rsquo;t want to waste three hours chasing their tails… 😄&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to use Delta Lake with &lt;a href=&#34;https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/&#34;&gt;PySpark&lt;/a&gt; from within a Jupyter Notebook. Easy, right? Not if you&amp;rsquo;re like me and perhaps are new to it and rely on copy and paste of snippets you find across the internet to start with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever I tried, I kept hitting this error:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Py4JJavaError: An error occurred while calling o45.save.
: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: 
Failed to find data source: delta.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In short, the problem was that I was creating both a &lt;code&gt;SparkSession&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; a &lt;code&gt;SparkContext&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. I honestly don&amp;rsquo;t understand enough about Spark to tell you why this causes the error, but through a lot of painful trial and error I can tell you that it does. &lt;em&gt;Someone more knowledgable than me can perhaps tell me (&lt;a href=&#34;mailto:robin@rmoff.net&#34;&gt;email&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/rmoff/&#34;&gt;twitter&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=&#34;https://data-folks.masto.host/@rmoff&#34;&gt;mastodon&lt;/a&gt;) why this is and if what I&amp;rsquo;ve ended up with is the right code&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;UPDATE: Damon Cortesi explained it to me :) See &lt;a href=&#34;#why-did-it-do-what-it-did&#34;&gt;below&lt;/a&gt; for details.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the example that doesn&amp;rsquo;t work, you explicitly create a &lt;code&gt;SparkContext&lt;/code&gt; first with &lt;code&gt;sc = SparkContext(&#39;local[*]&#39;)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you use &lt;code&gt;SparkSession.builder&lt;/code&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;code&gt;getOrCreate()&lt;/code&gt;, it reuses the &lt;code&gt;SparkContext&lt;/code&gt; you already created. You should be able to see this by running &lt;code&gt;spark.sparkContext&lt;/code&gt;. That &lt;code&gt;SparkContext&lt;/code&gt; unfortunately doesn&amp;rsquo;t have the config variables you specified and, based on some reason I don&amp;rsquo;t totally understand, the config variables you specify later are not updated. I&amp;rsquo;m guessing this is because &lt;code&gt;SparkContext&lt;/code&gt; spins up a JVM and some options (like &lt;code&gt;spark.jars.packages&lt;/code&gt;) would need to be specified before you spin up the JVM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the example that works, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a &lt;code&gt;SparkContext&lt;/code&gt; to reuse, so it creates a one using the config you provided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;😅 I love Spark! /s&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post does a pretty good job of explaining what&amp;rsquo;s going on: &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@achilleus/spark-session-10d0d66d1d24&#34;&gt;A tale of Spark Session and Spark Context&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a neat little trick you can use with &lt;a href=&#34;https://duckdb.org/&#34;&gt;DuckDB&lt;/a&gt; to convert a CSV file into a Parquet file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34; data-lang=&#34;sql&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#008000;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;COPY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#008000;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#666&#34;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt;	    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#008000;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;read_csv(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ba2121&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;~/data/source.csv&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;,AUTO_DETECT&lt;span style=&#34;color:#666&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#008000;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;TRUE&lt;/span&gt;))&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#008000;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;TO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ba2121&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;~/data/target.parquet&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;(FORMAT&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ba2121&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;PARQUET&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;CODEC&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ba2121&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;ZSTD&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;);&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can modify the schema too if you want, selecting specific fields and renaming them too if you want:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34; data-lang=&#34;sql&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#008000;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;COPY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#008000;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;col1,&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;col2,&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;col3&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#008000;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;AS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;foo&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt;	    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#008000;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;read_csv(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ba2121&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;~/data/source.csv&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;,AUTO_DETECT&lt;span style=&#34;color:#666&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#008000;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;TRUE&lt;/span&gt;))&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#008000;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;TO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ba2121&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;~/data/target.parquet&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;(FORMAT&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ba2121&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;PARQUET&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;CODEC&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ba2121&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;ZSTD&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;);&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt;

      <title>Making the move from Alfred to Raycast</title>

      <media:content xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://rmoff.net/images/2023/03/t_DSCF8412.jpeg" medium="image" type="image/jpg" width="100" height="100" />
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It all started with a tweet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Raycast is blowing my mind. It&amp;#39;s the 20% of macOS I didn&amp;#39;t realize was missing. It&amp;#39;s everything I wanted Alfred to be. It&amp;#39;s clearly made by people obsessed with nailing the details. It&amp;#39;s been 2 days and I can&amp;#39;t remember how I used my computer before it.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; dcj.eth (@dcwj) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/dcwj/status/1623373904612888588?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;February 8, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see, &lt;a href=&#34;https://rmoff.net/2021/07/29/why-i-use-alfred-app-and-maybe-you-should-too/&#34;&gt;I have a soft spot for Alfred&lt;/a&gt; so this piqued my interest on two fronts. First, &lt;em&gt;how dare anyone say anything about this great tool&lt;/em&gt;. Second…what if I&amp;rsquo;m missing out?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The subsequent short thread only drew me in further&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;🔥 Not gonna lie…this bit stung:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;idc keep using Alfred if you can’t be bothered to try new things&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so here we are. And I&amp;rsquo;m rather glad that we are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;stressing-my-alfred-fanboi-credentials&#34;&gt;Stressing my Alfred fanboi credentials&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we get into things, let me say this. I&amp;rsquo;ve used Alfred since almost as long as I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Macs, becoming a powerpack subscriber back in 2012 with v1. Alfred would be one of the first applications I&amp;rsquo;d install on any new Mac. Using a Mac without Alfred installed felt like trying to tie my shoelaces with one hand behind my back, and wearing a thick glove on the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But…time moves on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-raycast&#34;&gt;What is Raycast?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.raycast.com/&#34;&gt;Raycast&lt;/a&gt; is a launcher, kinda like Spotlight that comes built into macOS. To say that is to understate things somewhat significantly. It&amp;rsquo;s an all-singing and all-dancing productivity tool for your Mac that you really should try out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;introducing-raycast-the-newish-kid-on-the-block&#34;&gt;Introducing Raycast, the new(ish) kid on the block.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raycast is like Alfred, but better. Sorry Alfred. Whatever Alfred can do, Raycast can do, and usually better, in a simpler and more intuitive user interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost everything in Raycast is driven through its menu system which has been brilliantly thought out, along with a fantastic ecosystem of extensions accessed through the built-in &amp;ldquo;store&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-superb-user-experience&#34;&gt;A Superb User Experience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The user interface of Raycast has been superbly thought out to make it joyfully simple and straightforward, but also richly featured for more advanced uses when you need it - without the need to context switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s say we&amp;rsquo;ve launched the GitHub extension to interact with our PRs etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://rmoff.net/images/2023/03/Pasted%20image%2020230303224304.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hit enter to select &lt;code&gt;My Pull Requests&lt;/code&gt;. The next screen has the same UI as all others in Raycast:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://rmoff.net/images/2023/03/Pasted_Image_03_03_2023__22_44.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-store-&#34;&gt;The Store 🛒&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alfred was Alfred. You can have the car in any colour so long as it&amp;rsquo;s black. Well, there are &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.alfredapp.com/workflows/&#34;&gt;workflows&lt;/a&gt; but I need to go to a web page to browse and read and … gosh it&amp;rsquo;s just not as simple as pressing &lt;code&gt;Cmd-Space&lt;/code&gt;, typing &lt;code&gt;Store&lt;/code&gt; (or the first couple of characters), and then searching for whatever you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interested in &lt;del&gt;losing all your money on a ponzi scheme&lt;/del&gt; crypto? Let&amp;rsquo;s see what Raycast has for that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cmd-Space to launch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start to type &lt;code&gt;store&lt;/code&gt; and hit enter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start to type &lt;code&gt;Crypto&lt;/code&gt; and hit enter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pick an extension and hit enter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press enter to launch the extension&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://rmoff.net/images/2023/03/Kapture%202023-03-03%20at%2022.37.23.gif&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is all without your hands leaving the keyboard, which I think is probably where the power of Raycast comes in. It soon becomes part of your muscle-memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raycast becomes the platform for a potentially vast ecosystem of plugins. It&amp;rsquo;s the kitchen utensils for making whatever nice meal you&amp;rsquo;d like, instead of the pre-packaged ready meal you bought from the supermarket. That ready meal might be really nice, but you get what you get and nothing more. The half-assed metaphor breaks down because of course you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; extend Alfred. It just never felt like it was designed from the outset to be used that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;searching-for-files&#34;&gt;Searching for files&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Searching for files is fairly basic table-stakes for a laucher app like this. But Raycast does it with style and aplomb. Each file can be directly dragged to a target application (useful when working with images, uploading PDFs, etc), as well as handled with a multitude of actions from the Cmd-K menu. These include copying the path of the file to the clipboard, opening it in an application of your choosing, or even deleting it. All of these options are available at your finger tips without needing to go anywhere near your touchpad or mouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://rmoff.net/images/2023/03/Pasted%20image%2020230303231855.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;clipboard-history&#34;&gt;Clipboard History&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This one weird trick&lt;/em&gt; … will make you &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; much more productive. Using a clipboard manager lets you access things you&amp;rsquo;ve copied to the clipboard previously, not just the most recent one. Alfred does that, plenty of other app do that… but Raycast potentially does it the best of all of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You get your text, obviously, but also your images. You get the metadata for each item, and you can filter by type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://rmoff.net/images/2023/03/Pasted%20image%2020230303225558.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;
You can drag and drop from the clipboard history onto a file prompt or into an application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;emojis&#34;&gt;Emojis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who doesn&amp;rsquo;t like a good emoji? The emoji plugin in Raycast is just much smarter and less clunky than the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mr-pennyworth/alfred-fastest-emoji#fastest-emoji-search-famos&#34;&gt;Alfred workflow which I was using before&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;img src=&#34;https://rmoff.net/images/2023/03/CleanShot%202023-02-13%20at%2011.29.45.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;alfred-was-first-now-raycasts-coming-for-you-too&#34;&gt;Alfred was first, now Raycast&amp;rsquo;s coming for you too…&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because Raycast has such a good framework for extensions and each command within an extension can have a hotkey bound to it there are other apps that Raycast can actually replace. One example is &lt;a href=&#34;https://manytricks.com/moom/&#34;&gt;Moom&lt;/a&gt;. Previously a favourite of mine for getting control of a cluttered workspace by resizing windows based on a hotkey press, this is now just done by the Window Management extension which is built in to Raycast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://rmoff.net/images/2023/03/Pasted%20image%2020230303230601.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;quicklinks&#34;&gt;Quicklinks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar to the search engines you can define in Chrome, Quicklinks in Chrome lets you take a URL with a pattern for a search term and make it into a command accessible from the launcher at any time. Here&amp;rsquo;s an example for being able to search LinkedIn without first opening your web browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create Quicklink (which itself is accessed through the Raycast menu)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://rmoff.net/images/2023/03/CleanShot%202023-02-14%20at%2009.28.51.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Define the Quicklink based on the URL syntax of a LinkedIn search page URL &lt;code&gt;https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/all/?keywords={Query}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://rmoff.net/images/2023/03/CleanShot%202023-02-14%20at%2009.29.38.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you can enter the name of the quicklink (or partial) and search to your heart&amp;rsquo;s content:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://rmoff.net/images/2023/03/CleanShot%202023-02-14%20at%2009.30.10.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;switch-windows-with-filtering&#34;&gt;Switch windows with filtering&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like command-tab but without all the annoyance of a mouse 🤯&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://rmoff.net/images/2023/03/Raycast%202023-02-14%20at%2011.29.23.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;alfred-snippets---raycast-snippets--easy-peasy&#34;&gt;Alfred snippets -&amp;gt; Raycast snippets = easy peasy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with clipboard history, &lt;em&gt;snippets&lt;/em&gt; are a fantastic productivity tool. Whether auto-expanding your email address when you type &lt;code&gt;ep&lt;/code&gt;, entering the current timestamp, or even pasting your resume, it just speeds things up. The good news is that Raycast supports snippets, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://xavd.id/&#34;&gt;David Brownman&lt;/a&gt; wrote a nice tutorial on &lt;a href=&#34;https://xavd.id/blog/post/migrating-alfred-snippets-to-raycast/&#34;&gt;how to migrate your Alfred snippets to Raycast&lt;/a&gt;. Just make sure that each snippet has a name otherwise the import will fail. It&amp;rsquo;s fine to give it a dummy name - but it can&amp;rsquo;t be blank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;github-extension&#34;&gt;GitHub extension&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of all the tasks that you do on your computer each day. Many of those will have a Raycast extension that you can use to make it quicker and easier to get things done. Here&amp;rsquo;s an example with the GitHub extension to merge &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rmoff/rmoff-blog/pull/34&#34;&gt;the PR&lt;/a&gt; to publish this blog :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;video autoplay=&#34;true&#34; loop=&#34;true&#34; width=800 src=&#34;https://rmoff.net/images/2023/03/gh.mp4&#34;&gt;&lt;/video&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;sorry-but-the-time-has-come&#34;&gt;Sorry, but the time has come.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; you, not me. Raycast does everything Alfred did, but better.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What do you do when you want to query over multiple parquet files but the schemas don&amp;rsquo;t quite line up? Let&amp;rsquo;s find out 👇🏻&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve got a set of parquet files in S3 (well, lakeFS&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, but let&amp;rsquo;s not quibble over details) with the same datail split by year:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;$ lakectl fs ls lakefs://drones03/main/drone-registrations/
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;object          2023-03-01 09:47:36 +0000 UTC    30.7 kB         Registations-P107-Active-2016.parquet
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;object          2023-03-01 09:48:54 +0000 UTC    119.7 kB        Registations-P107-Active-2017.parquet
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;object          2023-03-01 09:44:47 +0000 UTC    594.3 kB        Registations-P107-Active-2018.parquet
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;object          2023-03-01 09:45:04 +0000 UTC    1.3 MB          Registations-P107-Active-2019.parquet
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;object          2023-03-01 09:48:12 +0000 UTC    2.8 MB          Registations-P107-Active-2020.parquet
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;object          2023-03-01 09:48:51 +0000 UTC    3.2 MB          Registations-P107-Active-2021.parquet
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I want to query and manipulate the data. DuckDB is my friend since it works with &lt;a href=&#34;https://duckdb.org/docs/data/parquet&#34;&gt;parquet files&lt;/a&gt;. I fire it up with an empty database:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;$ duckdb drones.duckdb
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;code&gt;DESCRIBE&lt;/code&gt; gives me the schema:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34; data-lang=&#34;sql&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;D&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#008000;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;DESCRIBE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#008000;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#666&#34;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#008000;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;read_parquet(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ba2121&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;s3://drones03/main/drone-registrations/Registations-P107-Active-*.parquet&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;That works, so we&amp;rsquo;re going to have to narrow down the problem. &lt;em&gt;As a side note, I should probably log an enhancement request for more detailed error messages (for example, which file had the error, and which field).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the error message there&amp;rsquo;s a data type problem with an &lt;code&gt;INT64&lt;/code&gt; field (&lt;code&gt;BIGINT&lt;/code&gt;). In the schema there are two fields with that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Physical Postal Code
Mailing Postal Code

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;So there&amp;rsquo;s the problem; the 2016 file uses &lt;code&gt;INT64&lt;/code&gt; for those fields whilst the remaining files use a string. The &lt;code&gt;SELECT&lt;/code&gt; that I ran above against all the files failed because when it tried to apply the schema of the first file against the data read from the others it ended up trying to convert a string to a number, which is never going to end well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s one way to fix things with a &lt;code&gt;UNION ALL&lt;/code&gt;. Note the use of &lt;code&gt;filename&lt;/code&gt; metadata column to help verify the data we&amp;rsquo;re getting is what&amp;rsquo;s expected. To start with let&amp;rsquo;s just try it against two files:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now we just need to specify the remainder of the files. Previously we wildcarded, but we can&amp;rsquo;t include the 2016 file in that (since we&amp;rsquo;re handling that with a &lt;code&gt;CAST&lt;/code&gt; in the first block of the &lt;code&gt;UNION&lt;/code&gt;), so we need to modify it.

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#008000;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#666&#34;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#008000;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bbb&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;x;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which then can be used the same as above like this:&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we enter December and 2022 draws to a close, so does a significant chapter in my working career—later this month I’ll be leaving Confluent and onto pastures new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s nearly six years since I wrote a &lt;a href=&#34;https://rmoff.net/2017/03/10/time-for-a-change/&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;moving on&amp;#39; blog entry&lt;/a&gt;, and as well as sharing what I’ll be working on next (and why), I also want to reflect on how much I’ve benefited from my time at Confluent and particularly the people with whom I worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sect1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;_looking_backwards&#34;&gt;Looking Backwards&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sectionbody&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m leaving Confluent with nothing but positive vibes about the company—and quite a feeling of sadness. Confluent was where I officially became a Developer Advocate, and was also my first start-up experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;strong&gt;March 2017&lt;/strong&gt;, I joined Confluent’s Business Development team as a &lt;em&gt;Partner Technology Evangelist&lt;/em&gt;. In October of that year, I spoke at Oracle OpenWorld (as it was called then), and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/tlberglund&#34;&gt;a random colleague 😉 who was also there&lt;/a&gt; suggested I go and watch some talks at the co-hosted JavaOne conference on a track called &amp;#34;&lt;em&gt;DevRel&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#34;. DevRel, you say? WTF is that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;imageblock&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;content&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://rmoff.net/images/2022/12/tweet.png&#34; alt=&#34;@rmoff on Twitter on 12:03 AM Oct 2&#34; width=&#34;2017: Apparently this has been a thing for years&#34; height=&#34;but #TIL the term DevRel.&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out this was a turning point for my career. I learnt in talks from &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/TheSteve0&#34;&gt;Steve Pousty&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/jbaruch&#34;&gt;Baruch Sadogursky&lt;/a&gt; that DevRel was a profession in itself, not just a sideline to try and cram in alongside a day job as I’d been doing for the previous seven years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward a few months to &lt;strong&gt;April 2018&lt;/strong&gt;, and I’d convinced &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/tlberglund&#34;&gt;Tim Berglund&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;for it was he, the random colleague who pointed me to the DevRel track at JavaOne&lt;/em&gt;) to take me on as a Developer Advocate in his DevX team at Confluent. Here I cut my teeth as a Developer Advocate learning my trade from Tim and colleagues &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/gamussa&#34;&gt;Viktor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/riferrei&#34;&gt;Ricardo&lt;/a&gt;. I learnt all about building authentic communities from the wonderful &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/ale_amurray&#34;&gt;Ale Murray&lt;/a&gt;, and about DevRel, communities, stream processing, and everything else from &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/gwenshap&#34;&gt;Gwen Shapira&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it’s not always just airmiles and smiles. As well as the practical side of the profession—crafting &lt;a href=&#34;https://talks.rmoff.net/&#34;&gt;slides&lt;/a&gt;, delivering &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5T99fPsK7pqp5Vdv8HtKVtwsuyGJEIeu&#34;&gt;talks&lt;/a&gt;, writing &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.confluent.io/blog/author/robin-moffatt/&#34;&gt;blogs&lt;/a&gt;, hacking &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/confluentinc/demo-scene/&#34;&gt;code&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/rmoff/status/1587382202781913089&#34;&gt;shitposting&lt;/a&gt;—I also learnt a lot about the human side of being a Developer Advocate. I wrote about this for two reasons: for those in the profession and perhaps wondering if they’re alone in finding it hard, as well as those looking in from the outside and thinking about pursuing it as a career. These blogs are perhaps the ones of which I’m the proudest. They don’t get tons of traffic, they didn’t go viral, they certainly didn’t make it to HackerNews. But they evidently resonated with many people judging by the number of folk who have told me that they enjoyed them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;ulist&#34;&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a similar vein but a bit more practical, here are a few about being a Developer Advocate in general:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;there are a bunch more &lt;a href=&#34;https://rmoff.net/categories/devrel/&#34;&gt;DevRel posts on this blog&lt;/a&gt;, including now this one which gets a bit recursive 😉&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;sectionbody&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January I’m going to be joining &lt;a href=&#34;https://lakefs.io/&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LakeFS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as a Principal DevEx Engineer, working on a great team led by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/polak-adi&#34;&gt;Adi Polak&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;axolotl&#34; class=&#34;imageblock&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;content&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://rmoff.net/images/2022/12/DSCF8441.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;An Axolotl on a rock near Ilkley’s famous Cow and Calf rocks&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;title&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;What’s a stuffed toy got to do with this? The Axolotl is &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.lakefs.io/faq.html#6-what-inspired-the-lakefs-logo&#34;&gt;LakeFS&amp;#39; mascot&lt;/a&gt; and excellent &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/gAmUssA/status/1577298515402924033&#34;&gt;conference swag&lt;/a&gt; :D&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sect2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;_why_lakefs&#34;&gt;Why LakeFS?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in 2016 in my previous role I spent a lot of time researching &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rittmanmead.com/blog/2016/12/source-control-and-automated-code-deployment-options-for-obiee/&#34;&gt;how to get Oracle’s BI tool&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kpbbb-pa2gU&#34;&gt;to integrate with source control&lt;/a&gt;, and I’m looking forward to taking a similarly rigorous approach to the thing that’s at the heart of everything we work with today: data. The data engineering space is a fast-moving one, with new releases arriving all the time to help us process data faster, bigger, smarter. But one of the things that I’ve seen that needs to be added to this is a serious consideration of how we, as data engineers, should adopt and embrace the kind of practices that software engineers would be simply embarrassed not to use. Things like version control and CI/CD to build truly resilient and repeatable deployments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://lakefs.io/&#34;&gt;LakeFS&lt;/a&gt; is an open-source tool that provides &amp;#34;git for data&amp;#34;. Just as you would branch code to go and try something out instead of writing directly to production, you can do the same with your data. LakeFS uses copy-on-write so that the mountain (or molehill) of data you’ve got doesn’t get duplicated each time you need a new version of it. This is just scratching the surface of what LakeFS can do, and I’m excited to start on a new adventure learning it inside and out—and working with people in the data engineering community to understand how it can work best for them too. I had a bit of a look at it &lt;a href=&#34;https://rmoff.net/categories/lakefs/&#34;&gt;previously&lt;/a&gt; and can’t wait to really get my teeth into it 😁.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sect1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;_parting_thoughts_community_ftw&#34;&gt;Parting Thoughts: Community, FTW&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sectionbody&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developer Advocacy is not just &lt;del&gt;shitposting and memes&lt;/del&gt; speaking at conferences and writing blogs. It’s also engaging with the community, helping developers, and more. Bringing this all together for me in late 2019 was the opportunity to join the Kafka Summit program committee, followed by becoming the chair of the program committee two years later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;imageblock&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;content&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://rmoff.net/images/2022/12/ksl.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ksl&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being on the program committee brings together lots of facets of life as a Developer Advocate. You get to work with the community, with other speakers, you get to influence how a conference is delivered, and pair all of that with a close understanding of trends and interests in the community and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most rewarding and most important aspects of my time at Confluent has been working with the Community. Whether at conferences, meetups, or online, I’ve made good friends, I’ve learnt lots - and hopefully shared a fair bit of knowledge back too. What I really like about a community is that it’s not got hard edges; communities overlap and come together in different guises. That is to say, I may not be working at Confluent but I will still be keeping in close touch with the Apache Kafka community, and hope to see some of y’all over in the broader data engineering and particularly the LakeFS community too 😄.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&#34;https://rmoff.net/2022/09/14/stretching-my-legs-in-the-data-engineering-ecosystem-in-2022/&#34;&gt;my quest&lt;/a&gt; to bring myself up to date with where the data &amp;amp; analytics engineering world is at nowadays, I’m going to build on my exploration of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://rmoff.net/2022/09/14/data-engineering-in-2022-storage-and-access/&#34;&gt;storage and access&lt;/a&gt; technologies and look at the tools we use for loading and transforming data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The approach that many people use now is one of &lt;strong&gt;EL-T&lt;/strong&gt;. That is, get the [raw] data in, and &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; transform it. I &lt;a href=&#34;https://rmoff.net/2022/10/02/data-engineering-in-2022-architectures-terminology/&#34;&gt;wrote about this in more detail elsewhere&lt;/a&gt; including the difference between ETL and ELT, and the difference between ELT now and in the past. In this article I’m going to look more at the tools themselves. That said, it’s worth recapping why the shift has come about. From my perspective it’s driven by a few things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;ulist&#34;&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One is the &lt;strong&gt;technology&lt;/strong&gt;. It’s &lt;em&gt;cheaper&lt;/em&gt; to store more data when storage is &lt;em&gt;decoupled from compute&lt;/em&gt; (HDFS, S3, etc). It’s also possible to &lt;em&gt;process bigger volumes of data&lt;/em&gt;, with the prevalence of distributed systems (such as Apache Spark) whether on-premises or the ubiquitous &lt;em&gt;Cloud datawarehouses&lt;/em&gt; (BigQuery, Snowflake, et al).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result of it being cheaper, and possible, to handle larger volumes of data means that we don’t have to over-optimise the front of the pipeline. In the past we &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; to transform the data before loading simply to keep it at a manageable size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working with the raw data has lots of benefits, since at the point of ingest you don’t know all of the possible uses for the data. If you rationalise that data down to just the set of fields and/or aggregate it up to fit just a specific use case then you lose the fidelity of the data that could be useful elsewhere. This is one of the premises and benefits of a data lake done well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;quoteblock&#34;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Of course, despite what the &amp;#34;data is the new oil&amp;#34; vendors told you back in the day, you can’t&lt;/em&gt; just &lt;em&gt;chuck raw data in and assume that magic will happen on it, but that’s a rant for another day ;-)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second shift—which is quite possibly related to the one above—that I see is the &lt;strong&gt;broadening of scope in teams and roles that are involved in handling data&lt;/strong&gt;. If you only have a single central data team they can require and enforce tight control of the data and the processing. This has changed in recent years and now it’s much more likely you’ll have multiple teams working with data, perhaps one sourcing the raw data, and another (or several others) processing it. That processing isn’t just aggregating it for a weekly printout for the board meeting, but quite possibly for multiple different analytical uses across teams, as well as fun stuff like &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/posts/gwenshapira_reverse-etl-why-is-it-a-big-deal-activity-6929868882778222592-FnZs/?trk=public_profile_like_view&#34;&gt;Reverse ETL&lt;/a&gt; and training ML models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what are the kind of tools we’re talking about here, and what are they like to use?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sect1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;_transformation_dbt&#34;&gt;Transformation - dbt&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sectionbody&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s cut to the chase on this one because it’s the easiest. Once your data is loaded (and we’ll get to &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; we load it after this), the transformation work that is done on it will quite likely be done by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.getdbt.com/&#34;&gt;dbt&lt;/a&gt;. And if it’s not, you’ll invariably encounter dbt on your journey of tool selection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;imageblock&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;content&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://rmoff.net/images/2022/09/dbt.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;dbt is everywhere&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everywhere I look, it’s dbt. People writing about data &amp;amp; analytics engineering are using dbt. Companies in the space with products to sell are cosying up to dbt and jumping on their bandwagon. It’s possible &lt;a href=&#34;https://benn.substack.com/p/how-dbt-fails&#34;&gt;it could fail&lt;/a&gt;…but not for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took me a while to grok where dbt comes in the stack but now that I (&lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt;) I have it, it makes a lot of sense. I can also see why, with my background, I had trouble doing so. Just as Apache Kafka isn’t easily explained as simply another database, another message queue, etc, dbt isn’t just another Informatica, another Oracle Data Integrator. &lt;strong&gt;It’s not about ETL or ELT - it’s about T alone&lt;/strong&gt;. With that understood, things slot into place. This isn’t just my take on it either - dbt themselves call it out &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.getdbt.com/blog/what-exactly-is-dbt/&#34;&gt;on their blog&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;quoteblock&#34;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;dbt is the T in ELT&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;quoteblock&#34;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;imageblock&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;content&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.getdbt.com/ui/img/blog/what-exactly-is-dbt/1-BogoeTTK1OXFU1hPfUyCFw.png&#34; alt=&#34;dbt high-level view&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What dbt does is use SQL with &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/jinja-macros#overview&#34;&gt;templating&lt;/a&gt; (and &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/building-models/python-models&#34;&gt;recently added support for Python&lt;/a&gt;) to express data transformations, build dependency graphs between those, and executes them. It does a bunch of things around this including testing, incremental loading, documentation, handling environments, and so on—but at its heart that’s all its doing. &lt;em&gt;This raw table of website clicks here, let’s rename these fields, un-nest this one, mask that one, and aggregate that other one. Use the result of that to join to order data to produce a unified view of website/order metrics&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a simple example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;imageblock&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;content&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://rmoff.net/images/2022/11/sql01.png&#34; alt=&#34;Extract of SQL from https://github.com/rmoff/current-dbt/blob/main/models/staging/stg_session.sql&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this the only difference from straight-up regular SQL is &lt;code&gt;{{ ref(&amp;#39;stg_scans&amp;#39;) }}&lt;/code&gt; which refers to another SQL definition (known as a &amp;#39;model&amp;#39;), and which gives dbt the smarts to know to build that one before this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A more complex example looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;imageblock&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;content&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://rmoff.net/images/2022/11/sql02.png&#34; alt=&#34;Extract of SQL from https://github.com/rmoff/current-dbt/blob/main/models/staging/stg_ratings.sql&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we’ve got some &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/jinja-macros&#34;&gt;Jinja&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;which technically the&lt;/em&gt; &lt;code&gt;ref()&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em&gt;is above but let’s not nit-pick&lt;/em&gt;) to iterate over three different values of an entity (&lt;code&gt;rating_type&lt;/code&gt;) in order to generate some denormalised SQL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That, in a nutshell, is what dbt does. You can read more about &lt;a href=&#34;https://rmoff.net/2022/10/24/data-engineering-in-2022-wrangling-the-feedback-data-from-current-22-with-dbt/&#34;&gt;my experiments&lt;/a&gt; with it as well as check out their super-friendly and helpful &lt;a href=&#34;https://community.getdbt.com/&#34;&gt;community&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sect1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;_so_weve_figured_out_transformationwhat_about_extract_and_load&#34;&gt;So we’ve figured out Transformation…what about Extract and Load?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sectionbody&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst dbt seems to be dominant in the Transform space, the ingest of data prior to transformation (a.k.a. &amp;#34;Extract &amp;amp; Load&amp;#34;) is offered by numerous providers. Almost all are &amp;#34;no-code&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;low-code&amp;#34;, and an interesting shift from times of yore is that the sources from which data is extracted is often not an in-house RDBMS but a SaaS provider - less Oracle EBS in your local data center and more Salesforce in the Cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fivetran.com/&#34;&gt;Fivetran&lt;/a&gt; is an established name here, along with many others including &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.stitchdata.com/&#34;&gt;Stitch&lt;/a&gt; (now owned by Talend), &lt;a href=&#34;https://airbyte.com/&#34;&gt;Airbyte&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/products/data-factory/&#34;&gt;Azure Data Factory&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://segment.com/&#34;&gt;Segment&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.matillion.com/&#34;&gt;Matillion&lt;/a&gt;, and more. Many of these also offer some light transformation of data along the way (such as masking or dropping sensitive fields, or massaging the schema of the data).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sect1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;_checking_out_fivetran_and_airbyte&#34;&gt;Checking out Fivetran and Airbyte&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sectionbody&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve taken a look at a couple of SaaS E/L providers side-by-side to understand what they do, what it’s like to use them, and any particular differences. I picked &lt;strong&gt;Fivetran&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Airbyte&lt;/strong&gt;, the former because it’s so commonly mentioned, the latter because they were at &lt;a href=&#34;https://2022.currentevent.io/website/39543/sponsors/&#34;&gt;Current 2022&lt;/a&gt; and had nice swag :D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Airbyte offer a comparison &lt;a href=&#34;https://airbyte.com/etl-tools/fivetran-alternative-airbyte&#34;&gt;between themselves and Fivetran&lt;/a&gt; - taken with a pinch of salt it’s probably a useful starting point if you want to get into the differences between them. Airbyte is &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte&#34;&gt;open-source and available to run yourself&lt;/a&gt;, and also as a cloud service (which is what I’m going to use).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sect2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;_signup&#34;&gt;Signup&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both services offer a 14-day free trial, with fairly painless signup forms&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;imageblock&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;content&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://rmoff.net/images/2022/11/ftab01.png&#34; alt=&#34;Fivetran and Airbyte - signup forms pt 1&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fivetran wants more data from me and makes me validate my email before letting me in whilst Airbyte wants to validate my email but lets me straight into the dashboard which is nice. Fivetran also sends annoying SDR nurture emails after signup which Airbyte doesn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;imageblock&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;content&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://rmoff.net/images/2022/11/ftab02.png&#34; alt=&#34;Fivetran and Airbyte - signup forms pt 2&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sect2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;_getting_started&#34;&gt;Getting started&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first screen that I land on after signup for Airbyte feels nicer - a big &amp;#34;Set up your first connection&amp;#34; button, which resonates more than Fivetran’s &amp;#34;Add destination&amp;#34;. For me that’s back-to-front since I want to tell it where to get data from and then I’ll explain where to put it. But perhaps that’s just me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;imageblock&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;content&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://rmoff.net/images/2022/11/ftab03.png&#34; alt=&#34;Fivetran and Airbyte - initial dashboard after signup&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For both services I’m going to use GitHub as a source, and BigQuery as my target, with the theoretical idea of creating an analysis of my blog updates (it’s &lt;a href=&#34;https://rmoff.net/categories/github/&#34;&gt;hosted on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;). To this I could add in the future other data sources such as Google Analytics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I click the big &amp;#34;Add destination&amp;#34; button in Fivetran and get asked what destination I want to create. This is a bit confusing, and I can see listed already one destination called &amp;#34;Warehouse&amp;#34;. I cancel that dialog, and click on the &amp;#34;Edit&amp;#34; button next to the existing destination. This just renames it, so I cancel that. Third time lucky—I click on the &amp;#34;Warehouse&amp;#34; destination name itself and now I’ve launched a 🧙🪄wizard! I click &amp;#34;Skip question&amp;#34;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;imageblock&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;content&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://rmoff.net/images/2022/11/ftab04.png&#34; alt=&#34;Fivetran can be confusing&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sect2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;_selecting_the_source&#34;&gt;Selecting the source&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several clicks in Fivetran and some confusion later, I’ve caught up with where Airbyte was after the single obvious &amp;#34;Set up your first connection&amp;#34; click - selecting my source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;imageblock&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;content&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://rmoff.net/images/2022/11/ftab05.png&#34; alt=&#34;Fivetran and Airbyte - selecting a source&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Airbyte lists the connectors alphabetically, and you can also search. Fivetran lists its connectors…randomly?? and its search seem to return odd partial match results&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;imageblock&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;content&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://rmoff.net/images/2022/11/ftab06.png&#34; alt=&#34;Fivetran and Airbyte - searching for a connector&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sect2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;_configuring_the_source&#34;&gt;Configuring the source&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the GitHub connector selected on both, I can now configure it. Both have a nice easy &amp;#34;Authenticate&amp;#34; button which triggers the authentication with my GitHub account. Once done I can select for which repository I want to pull data. Airbyte lets me type it freeform (which is faster but error-prone and relies on me knowing the exact name and owner), whilst Fivetran insists that I only pick from an available list that it has to fetch (mildly annoying if you know the exact name already)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Airbyte slightly annoyingly insists that I enter a &amp;#34;Start date&amp;#34; which I would definitely want the &lt;em&gt;option&lt;/em&gt; to do but not mandatory. By default I’d assume I want all data (which is presumably the assumption that Fivetran made because I didn’t have to enter it). I have to freeform enter an ISO timestamp, for which the tooltip helpfully shows the format but is still an extra step nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both connectors run a connection test after the configuration is complete&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;imageblock&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;content&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://rmoff.net/images/2022/11/ftab07.png&#34; alt=&#34;Fivetran and Airbyte - testing a connector&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sect2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;_configuring_the_target&#34;&gt;Configuring the target&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we specify the target for the data. The BigQuery connector is easy to find on the list of destinations that each provide. As a side note, one thing I’ve noticed with the Fivetran UI is that it’s the more old-school &amp;#34;select, click next, select, click next&amp;#34; vs Airbyte’s which tends to just move on between screens once you select the option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For my BigQuery account I’ve created and exported a private key for a service account (under &lt;code&gt;IAM &amp;amp; Admin&lt;/code&gt; → &lt;code&gt;Service Accounts&lt;/code&gt;, then select the service account and &lt;code&gt;Keys&lt;/code&gt; tab, and &lt;code&gt;Create new key&lt;/code&gt;). Both Fivetran and Airbyte just have a password field into which to paste the multi-line JSON. It seems odd but it works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than the authentication key, Fivetran just needs the Project ID and it’s ready to go. Airbyte also needs a default Dataset location and ID. On the click-click-click done stakes, Fivetran is simpler in this respect (few options that &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to be set).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;imageblock&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;content&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://rmoff.net/images/2022/11/ftab08.png&#34; alt=&#34;Fivetran and Airbyte - setting up BigQuery destination&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sect2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;_configuring_the_extract&#34;&gt;Configuring the extract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the connection has been validated, Fivetran and Airbyte move on to what data is to be synced, and how. The screens diverge a bit here so I’ll discuss them one at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fivetran keeps things simple with an option to just &lt;code&gt;Sync all data&lt;/code&gt; (default), or &lt;code&gt;Choose columns to block or hash&lt;/code&gt;. If I select the latter than Fivetran goes off the get the schema and then somewhat jarringly does a &amp;#34;don’t call us, we’ll call you&amp;#34; screen, promising to email me when things are ready…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&#34;https://rmoff.net/images/2022/11/ftab09.png&#34; alt=&#34;Fivetran - masking sensitive data&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…after which &lt;code&gt;Continue&lt;/code&gt; dumps you on a dashboard from which it’s kinda unclear what I do now. Did I create my connector? Is it syncing everything (there’s a spinning action icon next to &lt;code&gt;Status&lt;/code&gt; so perhaps?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;imageblock&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;content&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://rmoff.net/images/2022/11/ftab10.png&#34; alt=&#34;Fivetran - I’m confused.&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clicking on the pipeline provides the clarity that was missing previously:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;imageblock&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;content&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://rmoff.net/images/2022/11/ftab11.png&#34; alt=&#34;Fivetran - I’m less confused.&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst I sit tight, barely able to control my anticipation at getting the promised email from Fivetran about the schema, I head over to Airbyte. The last thing I did here was confirm my BigQuery connection details, which were successfully tested. If we remember what Fivetran did—a simple screen with two simple buttons &amp;#34;Let’s go&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Let’s mask some fields&amp;#34;, Airbyte’s is somewhat different. You could say bewildering; you could say powerful - 🍅tomato/🍅tomato, 🥔potato/🥔potato.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;imageblock&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;content&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://rmoff.net/images/2022/11/ftab12.png&#34; alt=&#34;Airbyte - Connection configuration screen&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It starts off simple - how often do we want to sync, what do we call it. Then what is our &lt;code&gt;Destination Namespace&lt;/code&gt;? Here’s the abstraction coming through, because as a bit of a n00b to all this I’d rather it be asking with the specific term relevant to my destination. What &lt;code&gt;Dataset&lt;/code&gt; do I want to write to in BigQuery? But OK, we’ve wrapped our heads around that. But now… now…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;imageblock&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;content&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://rmoff.net/images/2022/11/ftab13.png&#34; alt=&#34;Airbyte - Stream activation&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;a name=&#34;airbyte-ui&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My two big issues with this are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;olist arabic&#34;&gt;
&lt;ol class=&#34;arabic&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m thrown in hard and deep to the world of &lt;strong&gt;Sync mode&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Cursor field&lt;/strong&gt;, and more. These things exist, and are important, but I’m just a humble n00b trying to find my way in the world. Do I &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to know this stuff now? If Fivetran can abstract it, hide it, or set some suitable defaults, why can’t Airbyte? Sure, give me an &amp;#34;advanced options&amp;#34; button to display this, but I’m pretty daunted now. This brings me to my next issue:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The user interface (UI) is &lt;em&gt;not clear&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;ulist&#34;&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, do I &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to change any of these options, or can I just proceed? If I scroll all the way down there’s actually a &lt;code&gt;Set up connection&lt;/code&gt; button that’s not greyed out, so perhaps I can just click on that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;imageblock&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;content&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://rmoff.net/images/2022/11/ftab14.png&#34; alt=&#34;Airbyte - Stream activation again&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, assuming I want to change the stream sync config, this UI is even more confusing. I click on one or more checkboxes next to a stream, and something appears at the top? Why does Sync toggle but not change the toggles below? And is &lt;code&gt;Apply&lt;/code&gt; going to &lt;code&gt;Apply&lt;/code&gt; all the connector changes or just the streams that are checked? These are rhetorical questions and I can probably guess - but I shouldn’t have to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;imageblock&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;content&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://rmoff.net/images/2022/11/ftab15.gif&#34; alt=&#34;Airbyte - Stream activation UI is not so nice&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps GitHub is an unfortunate source to have started with, because the list of objects to sync is so long. For now, I ignore all the scary stuff and just click on &lt;code&gt;Set up connection&lt;/code&gt;. Now I’m back to the nice-and-easy workflow, and the synchronization has started&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;imageblock&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;content&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://rmoff.net/images/2022/11/ftab16.png&#34; alt=&#34;Airbyte - Synchronisation&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in Fivetran world I’ve still not received the promised email so I head to &lt;code&gt;Setup&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Edit connection details&lt;/code&gt; to see if I can tell it to forget the bit about masking fields (because I just want to set up a pipeline, any pipeline) and just start synchronising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;imageblock&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;content&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://rmoff.net/images/2022/11/ftab17.png&#34; alt=&#34;Fivetran - Connection details&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strangely it’s not under Setup (but I only find this out after waiting for it to test the connection again), but &lt;code&gt;Schema&lt;/code&gt;. Which kinda makes sense, except the wizard workflow was as one, so in my defence I expected it all under &lt;code&gt;Setup&lt;/code&gt; 🤷&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the schema, I can select which objects and fields within them to sync. If I didn’t want to include the author of a commit, for example, I could drop that here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;imageblock&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;content&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://rmoff.net/images/2022/11/ftab18.png&#34; alt=&#34;Fivetran - Select data to sync&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After hitting &lt;code&gt;Save and Continue&lt;/code&gt; I get an error which is a shame&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;imageblock&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;content&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://rmoff.net/images/2022/11/ftab19.png&#34; alt=&#34;Fivetran - computer says No&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ignoring the error I’m then prompted for how I’d like to handle schema changes, with a helpful description under each - and after that, a nice big button to click on to start the initial sync 😅&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;imageblock&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;content&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://rmoff.net/images/2022/11/ftab20.png&#34; alt=&#34;Fivetran - handling schema changes&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;imageblock&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;content&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://rmoff.net/images/2022/11/ftab21.png&#34; alt=&#34;Fivetran - LFG!&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sect2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;_sync_status_and_details&#34;&gt;Sync status and details&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m now at the point at which both tools are successfully pulling data from GitHub to load into BigQuery. Each has a status screen and a view with logs and more details. If I’m being fussy (which I am) the Airbyte UI is more responsive to the window width, whilst the Fivetran one I have to keep resizing because of a left-hand nav which seems intent on grabbing a fair proportion of the available space for not much purpose…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;imageblock&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;content&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://rmoff.net/images/2022/11/ftab22.png&#34; alt=&#34;Fivetran and AirByte - Connector status view&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;imageblock&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;content&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://rmoff.net/images/2022/11/ftab23.png&#34; alt=&#34;Fivetran and AirByte - Connector logs&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two connectors are either pulling different data or implemented differently because whilst the Fivetran connector finishes within a few minutes, the Airbyte one is still going after more than 20 minutes and shows that it’s also been rate-limited and so paused itself for a further ~40 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;imageblock&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;content&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://rmoff.net/images/2022/11/ftab24.png&#34; alt=&#34;Fivetran and AirByte - Timings&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Airbyte eventually completed after over an hour - but also with 72MB of data vs 2MB from Fivetran.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;imageblock&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;content&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://rmoff.net/images/2022/11/ftab25.png&#34; alt=&#34;AirByte - eventually finished&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sect2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;_the_data_models_in_bigquery&#34;&gt;The data models in BigQuery&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fivetran and Airbyte load the data from the GitHub API into quite different tables in the destination. Whilst Fivetran uses a separate &lt;code&gt;staging&lt;/code&gt; dataset Airbyte uses a whole bunch of underscore-prefixed tables within the same target dataset as the resulting tables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;imageblock&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;content&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://rmoff.net/images/2022/11/ftab26.png&#34; alt=&#34;Fivetran and AirByte - Data loaded into BigQuery&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fivetran have published an &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lx6ez7-x-s-n2JCnCi3SjG4XMmx9ysNUvaNCaWc3I_I/edit&#34;&gt;Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) for their GitHub model&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;proving that data modelling never died and is actually remarkably useful&lt;/em&gt;) as well as &lt;a href=&#34;https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/github#features&#34;&gt;general documentation&lt;/a&gt; about how the connector handles deletes etc. It also ships a &lt;a href=&#34;https://fivetran.com/docs/transformations/data-models/github-data-model/github-source-model&#34;&gt;dbt model of this ingested data&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href=&#34;https://fivetran.com/docs/transformations/data-models/github-data-model/github-transform-model&#34;&gt;enrichment transformations for dbt&lt;/a&gt; for the data in this format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Airbyte’s documentation and model palls in comparison to Fivetran’s. Their docs cover the &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.airbyte.com/integrations/sources/github/#supported-sync-modes&#34;&gt;connector’s characteristics&lt;/a&gt; but nothing about the model itself. From what I can tell in the docs the objects written to BigQuery are basically a literal representation of what the GitHub API returns (and these are what are linked to in the docs, such as the &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.github.com/en/rest/commits/commits#list-commits&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;commits&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; object). As we’ll see in the next section, this makes the data much harder to work with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sect2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;_analysing_the_data&#34;&gt;Analysing the data&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going back to the idea of this exercise, I’ve got GitHub data so now I’ll try and analyse it. The Fivetran model is easy to work with, and just needs a single join out to another table which is easily identified to pull in the repository name and show a list of individual commits by author:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a look at the Airbyte data. There are 16 &lt;code&gt;commit&lt;/code&gt;-prefixed tables. If we start with the obvious &lt;code&gt;commits&lt;/code&gt; neither the schema nor preview immediately calls out where to start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;imageblock&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;content&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://rmoff.net/images/2022/11/ftab29.png&#34; alt=&#34;Airbyte’s GitHub data model&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need the date of commit, the name of the committer, the commit message, and the name of the repo. After poking around &lt;code&gt;commits_commit&lt;/code&gt; looks useful and gets us part-way there:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;listingblock&#34;&gt;

&lt;span style=&#34;color: #000000;font-weight: bold&#34;&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span style=&#34;color: #008080&#34;&gt;`devx-testing.airbyte.commits_commit`&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;color: #000000;font-weight: bold&#34;&gt;ORDER&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #000000;font-weight: bold&#34;&gt;BY&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span style=&#34;background-color: #f8f8f8&#34;&gt;author_date&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color: #000000;font-weight: bold&#34;&gt;DESC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;img src=&#34;https://rmoff.net/images/2022/11/ftab30.png&#34; alt=&#34;Querying Airbyte’s GitHub data model&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we’re missing the repository name. Now since we specified in the Airbyte extract to &lt;em&gt;only pull data for the&lt;/em&gt; &lt;code&gt;rmoff-blog&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em&gt;repo&lt;/em&gt; then we could brush this under the carpet. Otherwise we need to work out how to relate &lt;code&gt;commits_commit&lt;/code&gt; to other tables and find one with the repo name in too…which for now I’m going to punt into the &lt;code&gt;TODO&lt;/code&gt; realm :D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sect1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;_fivetran_and_airbyte_summary&#34;&gt;Fivetran and Airbyte - Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sectionbody&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both tools work well for easily ingesting data from GitHub into BigQuery. My assumption is that the experience is similar for all of the other sources and destinations that they support. Select the connector, configure it, and hit the big &amp;#34;Start Sync&amp;#34; button. Some connectors especially &lt;a href=&#34;https://fivetran.com/docs/databases/oracle/setup-guide&#34;&gt;in the RDBMS world&lt;/a&gt; are probably going to be more fiddly to configure. Of the two tools, Fivetran definitely leans more nicely into the approach of using sensible defaults and only insisting on user input where necessary when compared to Airbyte.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each have their own UI quirks, especially Airbyte’s &amp;#34;Stream activation&amp;#34; section that I &lt;a href=&#34;#airbyte-ui&#34;&gt;grumbled about above&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resulting data is more nicely modelled by Fivetran whereas Airbyte just gives you the raw API output (from what I can tell). The ERD that Fivetran publishes is a very nice touch, as are the &lt;a href=&#34;https://fivetran.com/docs/transformations/data-models&#34;&gt;dbt data models&lt;/a&gt; since it’s a fair assumption folk will be interested in using these to speed up the &amp;#34;time to delivery&amp;#34; further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had the privilege of ignoring one of the big real-world evaluation criteria for tool selection: cost. Both tools had a 14-day free trial, and selective browsing on Reddit suggests that the costs can quickly mount up with these tools (as with many SaaS offerings) if not used carefully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sect1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;_going_off_on_a_tangent_bespoke_api_ingest&#34;&gt;Going off on a tangent - Bespoke API Ingest&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;sectionbody&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something that I’d not spotted yet on my travels was a canonical pattern for ingesting data from a bespoke [REST] API. All the SaaS E/L tools have the usual list of cloud-and-on-premises data sources, but there are innumerable other sources of data that expose an API. This could be an in-house system for which the backend database isn’t made available (and the API provided as the only interface from which to fetch data), or it could be a third-party system that only offers a API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some examples of public third-party APIs would be the kind of data sources I’ve used for &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/confluentinc/demo-scene/&#34;&gt;projects in the past&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href=&#34;http://environment.data.gov.uk/flood-monitoring/doc/reference#api-summary&#34;&gt;flood monitoring data&lt;/a&gt; from a REST API, or the position of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.kystverket.no/en/navigation-and-monitoring/ais/access-to-ais-data/&#34;&gt;ships near Norway&lt;/a&gt; using an AIS endpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked this question on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/ykznde/what_tooltechnique_do_you_use_for_polling_data/&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;r/dataengineering&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/posts/robinmoffatt_dataengineering-datapipelines-analyticsengineering-activity-6993956725842178048-egI1?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&#34;&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt; and got a good set of replies, which I’ll summarise here. One of the things that I learnt from this is that there’s not a single answer or pattern here—it’s definitely much more of an area in which you’ll have to roll up your sleeves, whether to write some code or evaluate a bunch of tools with no clear leader in the field. A lot of the solutions drop back into either writing some code, and/or self-managing something. I thought there might be an obvious Fivetran equivalent, but it doesn’t seem so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
