<p>I&#8217;ve reviewed a bunch of abstracts in the last couple of days, here are some common suggestions I made:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>No need to include your company name in the abstract text. Chances are I&#8217;ve not heard of your company, and even if I have, what does it add to my comprehension of your abstract and what you&#8217;re going to talk about? Possible exception would be the "hot" tech companies where people will see a talk just because it&#8217;s Netflix etc</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I <em>really</em> don&#8217;t want just to read your project documentation/summary. It makes me worry your talk will be death by PowerPoint of the minutiae of something that&#8217;s only relevant in your company.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Following on from above, I want to see that there&#8217;s going to be things you&#8217;ll share <em>that are useful for other people in a similar situation</em>. Something that&#8217;s specific to your project, your company, doesn&#8217;t translate to mass-usefulness. Something that other people will hit, whether it&#8217;s technical or org-cultural, now <em>that</em> is interesting and is going to be useful</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If my eyes start to glaze over reading the abstract intro, already I&#8217;m assuming that your talk will make me bored too. Read it back out loud to yourselfâ€¦make sure each word justifies its place in the text. Boilerplate filler and waffle should be left on the cutting room floor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You need to strike a balance between giving enough detail about the contents of your talk that I am convinced you have interesting things to share, but without listing every nut and bolt of detail. Too much detail and it just becomes a laundry list. You need to whet people&#8217;s appetite for the actual meal, not put them off their food.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For heaven&#8217;s sake, proof read! If you can&#8217;t be arsed to use a spell checker, then I definitely wouldn&#8217;t trust you to prepare a talk of any quality. I&#8217;ve recently started using <a href="https://app.grammarly.com/">Grammarly</a> and it&#8217;s <em>excellent</em>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is all just IMHO, and I would strongly caveat it that I&#8217;ve never been on a program committee, so maybe others out there can set me straight if I&#8217;m going against the grain on any of this.</p>

<p>See also <a href="https://rmoff.net/2016/05/05/collection-of-articles-on-how-to-write-a-good-conference-abstract/">this list of good blogs with abstract writing advice</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&#8217;m always open to helping review draft abstracts; if you&#8217;d like me to look at yours put it in a Google Doc with review permissions and send it over to me.</p>

</ul>

<p>Some good feedback from <a href="https://twitter.com/rawkode">David McKay</a> in response to this article:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I always find that negative titles, on context and subject, particularly annoying; more so when it&#8217;s a double negative.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Your article, for example, would be better in the positive context of "Traps to Avoid When Writing an Abstract"</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Which I totally agree with. I&#8217;ve stuck with the original title out of sheer stubbornness, and a reflection on the grump I was in after reviewing a crap abstract ;)</p>

<p>More good feedback, from <a href="https://twitter.com/er1p">Erik Riedel</a>:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>there is a lot tied up in your 5th bullet - and I recently read some twitter CFP advice (forget from who) what you should put ALL the "coolest" points into your abstract - vs trying to save some sizzle for the talk itself - i.e. the reviewers want to know ALL the coolness, because they are judging against the entire mass of other submitted coolnesses - even if you would want only hook/bait for the abstract that will be in the conference program - I&#8217;d suggest you make that point part of your 5th bullet somehow - i.e. "whatever you do, make sure ALL your COOLEST points from the talk are in the abstract - the sizzle" - ok to leave out "nuts and bolts" as you say</p>
