      <description>Prompted by a question on StackOverflow I had a bit of a dig into how windows behave in ksqlDB, specifically with regards to their start time. This article shows also how to create test data in ksqlDB and create data to be handled with a timestamp in the past.
 For a general background to windowing in ksqlDB see the excellent docs.
 The nice thing about recent releases of ksqlDB/KSQL is that you can create and populate streams directly with CREATE STREAM and INSERT INTO respectively.</description>
