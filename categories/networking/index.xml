      <description>See also Kafka Listeners - Explained
A short post to help Googlers. On a single-node sandbox Apache Kafka / Confluent Platform installation, I was getting this error from Schema Registry, Connect, etc:
WARN [AdminClient clientId=adminclient-3] Connection to node -1 could not be established. Broker may not be available. (org.apache.kafka.clients.NetworkClient)  KSQL was throwing a similar error:
KSQL cannot initialize AdminCLient.  I had correctly set the machine&amp;rsquo;s hostname in my Kafka server.</description>

      <description>TL;DR When defining networking on Proxmox 4 LXC containers, use an appropriate CIDR suffix (e.g. 24) - don&amp;rsquo;t use 32!
On my Proxmox 4 server I&amp;rsquo;m running a whole load of lovely LXC containers. Unfortunately, I had trouble connecting to them. From a client machine, I got the error
ssh_exchange_identification: read: Connection reset by peer  On the server I was connecting to (which I could get a console for through the Proxmox GUI, or a session on using pct enter from the Proxmox host) I ran a SSHD process with debug to see what was happening:</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve got an EdgeRouter LITE (ERL) which I used as my home router until a powercut fried it a while ago (looks like I&amp;rsquo;m not the only one to have this issue). The symptoms were it powering on but not giving any DHCP addresses, or after a factory reset responding on the default IP of 192.168.1.1. It was a real shame, because it had been a great bit of kit up until then.</description>
