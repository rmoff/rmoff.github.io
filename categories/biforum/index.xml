      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s my presentation &amp;ldquo;Performance Testing and OBIEE&amp;rdquo; that I gave at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://rmoff.net/2010/05/21/rittmanmead-bi-forum-2010/&#34;&gt;RittmanMead BI Forum 2010&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://talks.rmoff.net/performance-testing-and-obiee-sd/&#34;&gt;Performance Testing and OBIEE.pptx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a Powerpoint 2007 file (pptx) for which you may need the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=048dc840-14e1-467d-8dca-19d2a8fd7485&amp;amp;displaylang=en&#34;&gt;Microsoft PowerPoint Viewer 2007&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;ve included copious notes on each slide which hopefully cover the gist of what I talked about when I was delivering it. There are also a handful of funky animations which is why I&amp;rsquo;ve left it in pptx and not exported to PDF or other format (sorry Open Office users).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>My first presentation - afterthoughts</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I delivered my first presentation today, at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rittmanmead.com/biforum2010/&#34;&gt;RittmanMead BI Forum&lt;/a&gt;.I was really nervous in the hours and minutes leading up to it, but once I got up there and started talking I actually quite enjoyed it. If you were in the audience, I&amp;rsquo;d love some feedback in the comments section below, particularly any &amp;ldquo;constructive criticism&amp;rdquo;. I obviously didn&amp;rsquo;t make too much of a mess of it, as I was awarded &amp;ldquo;best speaker&amp;rdquo; of the event, which was a great honour. Hopefully I&amp;rsquo;ll get the opportunity to present again soon, perhaps at an UKOUG event.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
