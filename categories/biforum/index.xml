      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s my presentation &amp;ldquo;Performance Testing and OBIEE&amp;rdquo; that I gave at the RittmanMead BI Forum 2010: Performance Testing and OBIEE.pptx
It&amp;rsquo;s a Powerpoint 2007 file (pptx) for which you may need the Microsoft PowerPoint Viewer 2007. I&amp;rsquo;ve included copious notes on each slide which hopefully cover the gist of what I talked about when I was delivering it. There are also a handful of funky animations which is why I&amp;rsquo;ve left it in pptx and not exported to PDF or other format (sorry Open Office users).</description>

      <description>I delivered my first presentation today, at the RittmanMead BI Forum.I was really nervous in the hours and minutes leading up to it, but once I got up there and started talking I actually quite enjoyed it. If you were in the audience, I&amp;rsquo;d love some feedback in the comments section below, particularly any &amp;ldquo;constructive criticism&amp;rdquo;. I obviously didn&amp;rsquo;t make too much of a mess of it, as I was awarded &amp;ldquo;best speaker&amp;rdquo; of the event, which was a great honour.</description>
