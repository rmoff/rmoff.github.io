      <description>I began travelling for my job when my first child was three months old. But don’t mistake correlation for causation…it wasn’t the broken nights&amp;#39; sleep that forced me onto the road, but an excellent job opportunity that seemed worth the risk. Nearly eight years later and I’m in a different job but still with a bunch of travel involved. How much I travel has varied. It’s tended to average around 30%, but has peaked at way more than that.</description>

      <description>How do you try and stay current on technical affairs, given only 24 hours in a day and a job to do as well? Here&amp;rsquo;s my take on it&amp;hellip;
 One of the many things that has changed perceptibly since the beginning of this century when I started working in IT is the amount of information freely available, and being created all the time. Back then, printed books and manuals were still the primary source of definitive information about a piece of software.</description>

      <description>After 5 years at Rittman Mead, 126 blog posts, 16 conferences, four published OTN articles, an Oracle ACE award - not to mention, of course, a whole heap of interesting and challenging client work - I&amp;rsquo;ve decided that it&amp;rsquo;s time to do something different.
Later this month I&amp;rsquo;ll be joining Confluent as a Partner Technology Evangelist, helping spread the good word of Apache Kafka and the Confluent platform.
 As always you can find me on Twitter @rmoff, for beer tweets, fried breakfast pics - and lots of Apache Kafka!</description>
