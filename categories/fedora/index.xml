      <description>kafkacat is one of my go-to tools when working with Kafka. It’s a producer and consumer, but also a swiss-army knife of debugging and troubleshooting capabilities. So when I built a new Fedora server recently, I needed to get it installed. Unfortunately there’s no pre-packed install available on yum, so here’s how to do it manually.
Note kafkacat is now known as kcat (ref). When invoking the command you will need to use kcat in place of kafkacat.</description>

      <description>When using preupgrade to upgrade an existing Fedora 14 installation to Fedora 15, the following two errors were encountered:
Failed to fetch release info No groups available in any repository The box sits on a network behind a proxy out to the web.
The resolution was to make sure that environment variables http_proxy and https_proxy are set: [sourcecode language=&amp;ldquo;bash&amp;rdquo;] export http_proxy=http://user:password@proxyserver:port export https_proxy=http://user:password@proxyserver:port [/sourcecode] Make sure you do this from the user from which you run preupgrade.</description>
