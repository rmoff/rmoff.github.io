      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve used Hugo for my blog for several years now, and it&amp;rsquo;s great. One of the things I love about it is the fast build time coupled with it&amp;rsquo;s live-reload feature. Using this I can edit my source (Markdown or Asciidoc) in one window, hit save, and see the preview update in my browser window next to it pretty much instantaneously. For copy-editing, experimenting with images, etc this is really helpful.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Using GitHub Actions to build automagic Hugo previews of draft articles</title>

      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This blog is written in Asciidoc, built using Hugo, and hosted on GitHub Pages. I recently wanted to share the draft of a post I was writing with someone and ended up exporting a local preview to a PDF - not a great workflow! This blog post shows you how to create an automagic hosted preview of any draft content on Hugo using GitHub Actions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is useful for previewing and sharing one’s own content, but also for making good use of GitHub as a collaborative platform - if someone &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rmoff/rmoff-blog/pull/4#pullrequestreview-933907051&#34;&gt;reviews and amends your PR&lt;/a&gt; the post gets updated in the preview too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Scheduling Hugo Builds on GitHub pages with GitHub Actions</title>

      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Over the years I’ve used various blogging platforms; after a brief dalliance with Blogger I started for real with the near-inevitable Wordpress.com. From there I decided it would be fun to self-host using Ghost, and then almost &lt;a href=&#34;https://rmoff.net/2018/12/17/moving-from-ghost-to-hugo/&#34;&gt;exactly two years ago to the day&lt;/a&gt; decided it definitely was not fun to spend time patching and upgrading my blog platform instead of writing blog articles, so headed over to my current platform of choice: Hugo hosted on GitHub pages. This has worked extremely well for me during that time, doing everything I want from it until recently.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Including content from external links with Asciidoc in Hugo</title>

      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I use &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt; for my blog, hosted on GitHub pages. One of the reasons I’m really happy with it is that I can use Asciidoc to author my posts. I was writing a blog recently in which I wanted to include some code that’s hosted on GitHub. I could have copied &amp;amp; pasted it into the blog but that would be lame!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With Asciidoc you can use the &lt;code&gt;include::&lt;/code&gt; directive to include both local files:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Moving from Ghost to Hugo</title>

      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;sect1&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;_why&#34;&gt;Why?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;sectionbody&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’ve been blogging for quite a few years now, starting on Blogger, soon onto &lt;a href=&#34;https://rnm1978.wordpress.com/&#34;&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt;, and then to Ghost a couple of years ago. Blogger was fairly lame, WP yucky, but I really do like Ghost. It’s simple and powerful and was &lt;em&gt;perfect&lt;/em&gt; for my needs. My needs being, an outlet for technical content that respected formatting, worked with a markup language (Markdown), and didn’t &lt;em&gt;f**k things up&lt;/em&gt; in the way that WP often would in its WYSIWYG handling of content.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
