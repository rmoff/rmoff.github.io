      <description>Following the Oracle CAF tutorial here, I got to Cloning Answers Requests section and then got stuck. I&amp;rsquo;d set up my environment exactly the same as in the tutorial, down to the same paths etc. After firing up the CAF to clone requests from the SampleSales catalog: I clicked on Next and got the error &amp;ldquo;Exception occurred when while initializing repository!!!&amp;rdquo;
By playing around with the passwords and path names I determined that both RPD files existed and that CAF could load them enough to validate the passwords.</description>
