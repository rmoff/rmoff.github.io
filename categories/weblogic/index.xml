      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve just returned from the RittmanMead 2010 BI Forum which this year was at the Seattle Hotel in Brighton Marina.
The event was limited to 50 attendees, and I think this was a good number. The event was explicitly pitched at a very technical expert level, and the audience very much represented this. Whereas at a larger conference you may find the odd manager wandering around pretending to be technical ;-) this event was most definitely not pitched at such types.</description>

      <description>Oracle have published an interesting doc 968223.1, entitled &amp;ldquo;Enterprise Deployment of Oracle BI EE on OC4J and App Servers&amp;rdquo;.
It details the differences between OC4J and OAS which is useful for the current versions of OBIEE. It then also gives a useful heads-up &amp;ndash; that WebLogic becomes the App server of choice in the next version of OBIEE
All of this changes in OBI EE 11g where several projects will become absolutely dependent upon an App Server.</description>
