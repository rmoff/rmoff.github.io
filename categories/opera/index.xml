      <description>A faithful FireFox user for many users, I&amp;rsquo;ve been having a rather delightful rekindling of my old love for Opera recently. Back in the days, when I was a beardless bairn, I even paid for Opera I liked it so much. Then Firefox came along and Opera got dropped by the wayside like a teenage crush.
Well Opera 10.5 was released recently and I&amp;rsquo;m liking it. I miss my Firefox extensions too much to switch entirely, but damn, Opera is FAST!</description>
