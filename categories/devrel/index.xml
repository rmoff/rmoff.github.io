      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve written quite a few talks over the years, but usually as a side-line to my day job. In my role as a Developer Advocate, talks are part of What I Do, and so I can dedicate more time to it. A lot of the talks I&amp;#8217;ve done previously have evolved through numerous iterations, and with a new talk to deliver for the &#34;Spring Season&#34; of conferences, I thought it would be interesting to track what it took from concept to actual delivery.</description>
