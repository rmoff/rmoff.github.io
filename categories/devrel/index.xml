      <description>Back in March 2020 the western world came to somewhat of a juddering halt, thanks to COVID-19. No-one knew then what would happen, but there was the impression that whilst the next few months were a write-off for sure, maybe things would pick up again later in the year.
 It‚Äôs now early December 2020, and nothing is picking up any time soon. Summer provided a respite from the high levels of infection and mortality (in the UK at least), but then numbers spiked again in many places around the world and what was punted down the river back in March is being firmly punted yet again now.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to conferences all being online, and thus my talks being delivered from my study‚Äîand &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/search?q=speakerselfie%20(from%3Armoff)&amp;amp;src=typed_query&amp;amp;f=live&#34;&gt;my habit of posting a #SpeakerSelfie&lt;/a&gt; each time I do a conference talk‚ÄîI often get questions about my setup. Plus, I‚Äôm kinda pleased with it so I want to show it off too ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Are Tech Conferences Dead?</title>
      <link>https://rmoff.net/2020/03/13/are-tech-conferences-dead/</link>

      <description>ü¶†COVID-19 has well and truly hit the tech scene this week. As well as being full of &amp;#34;WFH tips&amp;#34; for all the tech workers suddenly banished from their offices, my particular Twitter bubble is full of DevRel folk musing and debating about what this interruption means to our profession. For sure, in the short term, the Spring conference season is screwed‚Äî all the conferences are cancelled (or postponed).
 But what about the future?</description>

      <title>How to win [or at least not suck] at the conference abstract submission game</title>

      <description>Just over a year ago, I put together the crudely-titled &amp;#34;Quick Thoughts on Not Writing a Crap Abstract&amp;#34; after reviewing a few dozen conference abstracts. This time around I‚Äôve had the honour of being on a conference programme committee and with it the pleasure of reading 250+ abstracts‚Äîfrom which I have some more snarky words of wisdom to impart on the matter.
 Remind me‚Ä¶how does this conference game work? Before we really get into it, let‚Äôs recap how this whole game works, because plenty of people are new to conference speaking.</description>

      <title>Staying sane on the road as a Developer Advocate</title>

      <description>I‚Äôve been a full-time Developer Advocate for nearly 1.5 years now, and have learnt lots along the way. The stuff I‚Äôve learnt about being an advocate I‚Äôve written about elsewhere (here/here/here); today I want to write about something that‚Äôs just as important: staying sane and looking after yourself whilst on the road. This is also tangentially related to another of my favourite posts that I‚Äôve written: Travelling for Work, with Kids at Home.</description>

      <description>I‚Äôve had a relaxing couple of weeks off work over the summer, and came back today to realise that I‚Äôve got a fair bit of conference and meetup travel to wrap my head around for the next few months :)
 If you‚Äôre interested in where I‚Äôll be and want to come and say hi, hear about Kafka‚Äîor just grab a coffee or beer, herewith my itinerary as it currently stands.</description>

      <title>Quick Thoughts on Not Making a Crap Slide Deck</title>
      <link>https://rmoff.net/2019/03/19/quick-thoughts-on-not-making-a-crap-slide-deck/</link>

      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post is the companion to an earlier one that I wrote about &lt;a href=&#34;https://rmoff.net/2018/12/19/quick-thoughts-on-not-writing-a-crap-abstract/&#34;&gt;conference abstracts&lt;/a&gt;. In the same way that the last one was inspired by reviewing a ton of abstracts and noticing a recurring pattern in my suggestions, so this one comes from reviewing a bunch of slide decks for a forthcoming conference. They all look like good talks, but in several cases &lt;em&gt;these great talks are fighting to get out from underneath the deadening weight of slides&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herewith follows my highly-opinionated, fairly-subjective, and extremely-terse advice and general suggestions for slide decks. You can also find relating ramblings in &lt;a href=&#34;https://rmoff.net/2019/03/01/preparing-a-new-talk/&#34;&gt;this recent post&lt;/a&gt; too. My friend and colleague Vik Gamov also wrote &lt;a href=&#34;https://gamov.io/posts/2019/03/15/quick-tips-on-designing-your-next-presentation.html&#34;&gt;a good post&lt;/a&gt; on this same topic, and linked to &lt;a href=&#34;https://player.oreilly.com/videos/9781491954980&#34;&gt;a good video&lt;/a&gt; that I‚Äôd recommend you watch.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Preparing a New Talk</title>
      <link>https://rmoff.net/2019/03/01/preparing-a-new-talk/</link>

      <description>I‚Äôve written quite a few talks over the years, but usually as a side-line to my day job. In my role as a Developer Advocate, talks are part of What I Do, and so I can dedicate more time to it. A lot of the talks I‚Äôve done previously have evolved through numerous iterations, and with a new talk to deliver for the &amp;#34;Spring Season&amp;#34; of conferences, I thought it would be interesting to track what it took from concept to actual delivery.</description>

      <title>Travelling for Work, with Kids at Home</title>

      <description>I began travelling for my job when my first child was three months old. But don‚Äôt mistake correlation for causation‚Ä¶it wasn‚Äôt the broken nights&amp;#39; sleep that forced me onto the road, but an excellent job opportunity that seemed worth the risk. Nearly eight years later and I‚Äôm in a different job but still with a bunch of travel involved. How much I travel has varied. It‚Äôs tended to average around 30%, but has peaked at way more than that.</description>

      <description>I‚Äôve reviewed a bunch of abstracts in the last couple of days, here are some common suggestions I made:
   No need to include your company name in the abstract text. Chances are I‚Äôve not heard of your company, and even if I have, what does it add to my comprehension of your abstract and what you‚Äôre going to talk about? Possible exception would be the &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; tech companies where people will see a talk just because it‚Äôs Netflix etc</description>
