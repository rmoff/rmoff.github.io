      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;LLMs are &lt;em&gt;rapidly&lt;/em&gt; changing how we use the internet.&#xA;Remember just a few years ago when you’d search for something on Google and &lt;em&gt;scroll&lt;/em&gt; through the results like some kind of Neanderthal?&#xA;Heck, you might even click through to page 2 if you were feeling spicy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These days—&lt;em&gt;and, knowing how this stuff ages, I should perhaps be less broad than &amp;#34;these days&amp;#34; and say just &amp;#34;in January 2026&amp;#34;&lt;/em&gt;—Google’s AI Overview at the top of the results has got pretty good for basic stuff, making looking at the actual search results less necessary.&#xA;That’s if folk even &lt;em&gt;get&lt;/em&gt; to Google, when they’ve got an LLM close at hand to answer any and every question that they throw at it (regardless of whether it’s a lazy &amp;#34;&lt;em&gt;how do you spell irony&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#34; or somewhat more LLM-appropriate &amp;#34;&lt;em&gt;ELI5 nuclear fusion&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#34;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some would say that the perfect blog article takes the reader on a journey on in which the development process looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;imageblock&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;content&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;img src=&#34;https://rmoff.net/images/2025/03/blog_content1.excalidraw.webp&#34; alt=&#34;blog content1.excalidraw&#34;/&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Blog Writing for Developers</title>
      <link>https://rmoff.net/2023/07/19/blog-writing-for-developers/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Writing is one of the most powerful forms of communication, and it’s useful in a multitude of roles and contexts. As a &lt;a href=&#34;https://rmoff.net&#34;&gt;blog-writing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/treeverse/lakeFS/pulls?q=is%3Apr+label%3Adocs+author%3Armoff+&#34;&gt;documentation-authoring&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/rmoff/status/1587382202781913089&#34;&gt;twitter-shitposting&lt;/a&gt; DevEx engineer I spend a lot of my time writing. Recently, someone paid me a very nice compliment about a blog I’d written and asked how they could learn to write like me and what resources I’d recommend.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Never one to miss a chance to write and share something, here’s my response to this :)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What Does This DevEx Engineer Do?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This was originally titled more broadly &amp;ldquo;What Does &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; DevEx Engineer Do&amp;rdquo;, but that made it into a far too tedious and long-winding etymological exploration of the discipline. Instead, I&amp;rsquo;m going to tell you what this particular instantiation of the entity does 😄&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As we enter December and 2022 draws to a close, so does a significant chapter in my working career—later this month I’ll be leaving Confluent and onto pastures new.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It’s nearly six years since I wrote a &lt;a href=&#34;https://rmoff.net/2017/03/10/time-for-a-change/&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;moving on&amp;#39; blog entry&lt;/a&gt;, and as well as sharing what I’ll be working on next (and why), I also want to reflect on how much I’ve benefited from my time at Confluent and particularly the people with whom I worked.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Inside the Sausage Factory: How we Built the Program for Current 2022</title>

      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever been to a conference, particularly as a speaker whose submitted a paper that may or may not have been accepted, you might wonder quite how conferences choose the talks that get accepted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I had the privilege of chairing the program committee for Current and Kafka Summit this year and curating the final program for both. Here’s a glimpse behind the curtains of how we built the program for Current 2022. It was originally posted as a &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/rmoff/status/1549410161688813569&#34;&gt;thread on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

As the name implies - they are quick!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A good lightning talk is not just your breakout talk condensed into a shorter time frame. You can’t simply deliver the same material faster, or the same material at a higher level, or the same material with a few bits left out&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>How to Write a Good Tech Conference Abstract - Learn from the Mistakes of Others</title>

      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Building the program for any conference is not an easy task. There will always be a speaker disappointed that their talk didn’t get in—or perhaps an audience who are disappointed that a particular talk &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; get in. As the chair of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.confluent.io/en-gb/blog/introducing-current-2022-program-committee/&#34;&gt;program committee&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=&#34;https://2022.currentevent.io/&#34;&gt;Current 22&lt;/a&gt; one of the things that I’ve found really useful in building out the program this time round are the comments that the program committee left against submissions as they reviewed them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There were some common patterns I saw, and I thought it would be useful to share these here. Perhaps you’re an aspiring conference speaker looking to understand what mistakes to avoid. Maybe you’re an existing speaker whose abstracts don’t get accepted as often as you’d like. Or perhaps you’re just curious as to what goes on behind the curtains :)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Remote-First Developer Advocacy</title>
      <link>https://rmoff.net/2022/04/07/remote-first-developer-advocacy/</link>

      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’m convinced that a developer advocate &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be effective remotely. As a profession, we’ve all spent two years figuring out how to do just that. Some of it worked out great. Some of it, less so.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href=&#34;https://rmoff.net/2022/04/07/hanging-up-my-boarding-passes-and-jetlagfor-now/&#34;&gt;made the decision&lt;/a&gt; during COVID to stop travelling as part of my role as a developer advocate. In this article, I talk about my experience with different areas of advocacy done remotely.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I recently started writing an abstract for a conference later this year and realised that I’m not even sure if I want to do it. Not the conference—it’s a great one—but just the whole up on stage doing a talk thing. I can’t work out if this is just nerves from the amount of time off the stage, or something more fundamental to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Life as a Developer Advocate, nine months into a pandemic</title>

      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Back in March 2020 the western world came to somewhat of a juddering halt, thanks to COVID-19. No-one knew then what would happen, but there was the impression that whilst the next few months were a write-off for sure, &lt;em&gt;maybe&lt;/em&gt; things would pick up again later in the year.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It’s now early December 2020, and nothing is picking up any time soon. Summer provided a respite from the high levels of infection and mortality (in the UK at least), but then numbers spiked again in many places around the world and what was punted down the river back in March is being firmly punted yet again now.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

Plus, I’m kinda pleased with it so I want to show it off too ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Are Tech Conferences Dead?</title>

      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;🦠COVID-19 has well and truly hit the tech scene this week. As well as being full of &amp;#34;WFH tips&amp;#34; for all the tech workers suddenly banished from their offices, my particular Twitter bubble is full of DevRel folk musing and debating about what this interruption means to our profession. For sure, in the short term, the Spring conference season is screwed— &lt;a href=&#34;https://airtable.com/shrETNURgXNrGWbd8/tblc49hMMykARebo8?blocks=hide&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; the conferences&lt;/a&gt; are cancelled (or postponed).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But what about the future? No-one would ever &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to take such a forced hiatus but what an excellent opportunity it is to take a step back and consider why we’re doing what we’re doing - and if we should go back to business as usual once things calm down.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Just over a year ago, I put together the crudely-titled &lt;a href=&#34;https://rmoff.net/2018/12/19/quick-thoughts-on-not-writing-a-crap-abstract/&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Quick Thoughts on Not Writing a Crap Abstract&amp;#34;&lt;/a&gt; after reviewing a few dozen conference abstracts. This time around I’ve had the honour of being on a conference programme committee and with it the pleasure of reading 250+ abstracts—from which I have some more snarky words of wisdom to impart on the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;sect1&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;_remind_mehow_does_this_conference_game_work&#34;&gt;Remind me…how does this conference game work?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;sectionbody&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Before we really get into it, let’s recap how this whole game works, because plenty of people are new to conference speaking.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’ve been a full-time Developer Advocate for nearly 1.5 years now, and have learnt lots along the way. The stuff I’ve learnt about being an advocate I’ve written about elsewhere (&lt;a href=&#34;https://rmoff.net/2018/12/19/quick-thoughts-on-not-writing-a-crap-abstract/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=&#34;https://rmoff.net/2019/03/19/quick-thoughts-on-not-making-a-crap-slide-deck/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=&#34;https://rmoff.net/2019/03/01/preparing-a-new-talk/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;); today I want to write about something that’s just as important: staying sane and looking after yourself whilst on the road. This is also tangentially related to another of my favourite posts that I’ve written: &lt;a href=&#34;https://rmoff.net/2019/02/09/travelling-for-work-with-kids-at-home/&#34;&gt;Travelling for Work, with Kids at Home&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Quick Thoughts on Not Making a Crap Slide Deck</title>

      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This post is the companion to an earlier one that I wrote about &lt;a href=&#34;https://rmoff.net/2018/12/19/quick-thoughts-on-not-writing-a-crap-abstract/&#34;&gt;conference abstracts&lt;/a&gt;. In the same way that the last one was inspired by reviewing a ton of abstracts and noticing a recurring pattern in my suggestions, so this one comes from reviewing a bunch of slide decks for a forthcoming conference. They all look like good talks, but in several cases &lt;em&gt;these great talks are fighting to get out from underneath the deadening weight of slides&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Herewith follows my highly-opinionated, fairly-subjective, and extremely-terse advice and general suggestions for slide decks. You can also find relating ramblings in &lt;a href=&#34;https://rmoff.net/2019/03/01/preparing-a-new-talk/&#34;&gt;this recent post&lt;/a&gt; too. My friend and colleague Vik Gamov also wrote &lt;a href=&#34;https://gamov.io/posts/2019/03/15/quick-tips-on-designing-your-next-presentation.html&#34;&gt;a good post&lt;/a&gt; on this same topic, and linked to &lt;a href=&#34;https://player.oreilly.com/videos/9781491954980&#34;&gt;a good video&lt;/a&gt; that I’d recommend you watch.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’ve written quite a few talks over the years, but usually as a side-line to my day job. In my role as a Developer Advocate, talks are part of &lt;em&gt;What I Do&lt;/em&gt;, and so I can dedicate more time to it. A lot of the talks I’ve done previously have evolved through numerous iterations, and with &lt;a href=&#34;https://talks.rmoff.net/the-changing-face-of-etl-event-driven-architectures-for-data-engineers/&#34;&gt;a new talk to deliver&lt;/a&gt; for the &amp;#34;Spring Season&amp;#34; of conferences, I thought it would be interesting to track what it took from concept to actual delivery.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Travelling for Work, with Kids at Home</title>

      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I began travelling for my job when my first child was three months old. But don’t mistake correlation for causation…it wasn’t the broken nights&amp;#39; sleep that forced me onto the road, but an excellent job opportunity that seemed worth the risk. Nearly eight years later and I’m in a different job but still with a bunch of travel involved. How much I travel has varied. It’s tended to average around 30%, but has peaked at way more than that. I’ve worked in consultancy, business development, and as a developer advocate in that time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Quick Thoughts on Not Writing a Crap Abstract</title>

      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’ve reviewed a bunch of abstracts in the last couple of days, here are some common suggestions I made:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;ulist&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;No need to include your company name in the abstract text. Chances are I’ve not heard of your company, and even if I have, what does it add to my comprehension of your abstract and what you’re going to talk about? Possible exception would be the &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; tech companies where people will see a talk just because it’s Netflix etc&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; don’t want just to read your project documentation/summary. It makes me worry your talk will be death by PowerPoint of the minutiae of something that’s only relevant in your company.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Following on from above, I want to see that there’s going to be things you’ll share &lt;em&gt;that are useful for other people in a similar situation&lt;/em&gt;. Something that’s specific to your project, your company, doesn’t translate to mass-usefulness. Something that other people will hit, whether it’s technical or org-cultural, now &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; is interesting and is going to be useful&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If my eyes start to glaze over reading the abstract intro, already I’m assuming that your talk will make me bored too. Read it back out loud to yourself…make sure each word justifies its place in the text. Boilerplate filler and waffle should be left on the cutting room floor.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You need to strike a balance between giving enough detail about the contents of your talk that I am convinced you have interesting things to share, but without listing every nut and bolt of detail. Too much detail and it just becomes a laundry list. You need to whet people’s appetite for the actual meal, not put them off their food.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For heaven’s sake, proof read! If you can’t be arsed to use a spell checker, then I definitely wouldn’t trust you to prepare a talk of any quality. I’ve recently started using &lt;a href=&#34;https://app.grammarly.com/&#34;&gt;Grammarly&lt;/a&gt; and it’s &lt;em&gt;excellent&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
