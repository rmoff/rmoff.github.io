      <description>Logs are magical things. They tell us what an application is doing—or not doing. They help us debug problems. As it happens, they also underpin the entire philosophy of Apache Kafka, but that’s a story for another day. Today we’re talking about logs written by Kafka Connect, and how we can change the amount of detail written.
 By default, Kafka Connect will write logs at INFO and above. So when it starts up, the settings that it’s using, and any WARN or ERROR messages along the way - a missing configuration, a broken connector, and so on.</description>
