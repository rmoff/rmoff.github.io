      <description>This week I was scheduled in to a couple of meetups, in Vienna and Munich. Flying is an inevitable part of travel since I also happen to like being home seeing my family and airplanes are usually the quickest way to make this happen. I don&amp;#8217;t particularly enjoy flying, and there&amp;#8217;s the environmental impact of it too—so when I realised that Vienna and Munich are relatively close to each other I looked at getting the train.</description>

      <description>I began travelling for my job when my first child was three months old. But don&amp;#8217;t mistake correlation for causation…it wasn&amp;#8217;t the broken nights&#39; sleep that forced me onto the road, but an excellent job opportunity that seemed worth the risk. Nearly eight years later and I&amp;#8217;m in a different job but still with a bunch of travel involved. How much I travel has varied. It&amp;#8217;s tended to average around 30%, but has peaked at way more than that.</description>
