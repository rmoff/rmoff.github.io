      <description>&lt;p&gt;Prompted by &lt;a href=&#34;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55680719/aggregating-by-multiple-fields-and-map-to-one-result&#34;&gt;a question on StackOverflow&lt;/a&gt;, the requirement is to take a series of events related to a common key and for each key output a series of aggregates derived from a changing value in the events. I&amp;rsquo;ll use the data from the question, based on ticket statuses. Each ticket can go through various stages, and the requirement was to show, per customer, how many tickets are currently at each stage.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
