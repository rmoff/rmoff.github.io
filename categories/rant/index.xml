      <title>(AI) Smells on Medium</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As part of compiling the monthly &lt;a href=&#34;https://rmoff.net/categories/interesting-links/&#34;&gt;interesting links&lt;/a&gt; posts, I go through a ton of RSS feeds, sourced from specific blogs that I follow as well as general aggregators.&#xA;These aggregators include quality sources like InfoQ, and certain tags on lobste.rs.&#xA;Here I&amp;rsquo;ll often find some good articles that I missed in my general travels around the social media feeds in the previous month.&#xA;I also, so you don&amp;rsquo;t have to, dive into the AI slop-pit that is Medium and various categories feeds.&#xA;In amongst the detritus and sewage of LLMs left to ramble unchecked are the occasional proverbial diamonds in the rough, which make the sifting worth the effort.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I thought it might be interesting—and a useful vent to preserve my sanity—to note down some of the &amp;ldquo;smells&amp;rdquo; I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>OBIEE performance - get your database sweating</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just because something produces the correct numbers on the report, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean you can stop there.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How&lt;/strong&gt; you are producing those numbers matters, and matters a lot if you have an interest in the long-term health of your system and its ability to scale.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;OBIEE is the case in point here, but the principle applies to any architecture with &amp;gt;1 tiers or components.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let me start with a rhetorical question. The user has got a report which has ten rows of data. Which of the following methods is going to be a more efficient way to generate the report?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>When is a bug not a bug? When it&#39;s a &#34;design decision&#34;</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://rmoff.net/2010/09/02/misbehaving-informatica-kills-oracle/&#34;&gt;Last month I wrote about a problem&lt;/a&gt; that Informatica as part of OBIA was causing us, wherein an expired database account would bring Oracle down by virtue of multiple connections from Informatica.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I raised an SR with Oracle (under OBIA support), who after some back-and-forth with Informatica, were told:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is not a bug. That the two error messages coming back from Oracle are handled differently is the result of a design decision and as such not a product fault.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>RTFM? But where TF is the FM?  &gt;&gt; Offline searchable OBIEE 11g documentation</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a geek. I like understanding things in their absolute entirety. It frustrates me to have to make presumptions or assumptions about something. I like to get down &amp;rsquo;n dirty and find out what makes things tick.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So that necessitates reading manuals. And unfortunately, Oracle don&amp;rsquo;t make that easy all the time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some of the manuals &lt;a href=&#34;https://rmoff.net/2009/11/27/i-think-this-summarises-everything/&#34;&gt;are not very good&lt;/a&gt;, and others are difficult to find. Given the complexity of the OBIEE stack and proliferation of terminology and product names, sorting the wheat from the chaff can be a headache. Fair enough, for a corporation as big as Oracle with a product portfolio in the [hundreds? thousands?] creating a unified, comprehensive, easy-to-navigate point of reference for documentation must be near on impossible - but that&amp;rsquo;s their problem to figure out and mine to bitch about until it&amp;rsquo;s done ;-)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Oracle Support Blog back online, kinda.</title>
      <link>https://rmoff.net/2010/02/23/oracle-support-blog-back-online-kinda/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After it was &lt;a href=&#34;https://rmoff.net/2010/02/15/oracle-support-blog-no-more/&#34;&gt;ripped down last week&lt;/a&gt;, Chris Warticki&amp;rsquo;s blog is &lt;a href=&#34;http://blogs.oracle.com/Support/2010/02/support_blog_moved_to_my_oracl.html&#34;&gt;back online&lt;/a&gt;, albeit with the last posting redirecting visitors to a &lt;a href=&#34;https://communities.oracle.com/portal/server.pt/community/using_my_oracle_support/221&#34;&gt;new location on Oracle Communities&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Maybe I&amp;rsquo;m getting too old for this s##t, but I&amp;rsquo;m yet to really get a handle on how Oracle want to interact with real people on the ground. &lt;a href=&#34;https://communities.oracle.com/&#34;&gt;Oracle Communities&lt;/a&gt; is a fairly new site that I&amp;rsquo;ve not explored so much because of no OBIEE area. &lt;a href=&#34;http://support.oracle.com&#34;&gt;My Oracle Support&lt;/a&gt; has feedback and comment sections, but in general usability stinks. A support blog is torn down and then reappears. &lt;a href=&#34;http://forums.oracle.com&#34;&gt;Oracle Forums&lt;/a&gt; are popular as ever but the software blows and some forums (eg OBIEE) are withering under a very high noise to quality-content ratio. Oh, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://mix.oracle.com&#34;&gt;Oracle Mix&lt;/a&gt; (&amp;ldquo;Bringing Oracle Customers, Employees, and Developers together&amp;rdquo;) too, which looked quite neat but I have no idea how that&amp;rsquo;s supposed to fit it the picture.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>#Fail: My Oracle Support</title>
      <link>https://rmoff.net/2009/11/11/fail-my-oracle-support/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Metalink was retired this weekend and made way for the new My Oracle Support system. It didn&amp;rsquo;t go as smoothly as it could have done.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This post is going to be a bit of a rambling rant.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately people, including me, don&amp;rsquo;t like their &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who_Moved_My_Cheese%3F&#34;&gt;cheese being moved&lt;/a&gt; (not unless there&amp;rsquo;s a really runny piece of &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheese_Shop_sketch#Table_of_Cheeses&#34;&gt;Camembert&lt;/a&gt; at the end of it). That makes it a bit more difficult to discuss because some of people&amp;rsquo;s complaints will just be geeks being stubborn (and boy, can geeks be stubborn). Arguments descend into minutiae of detail and flash vs DHTML - whilst the bigger picture gets lost.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The state of OBIEE on the web</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;an-advance-footnote&#34;&gt;An advance footnote&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll start this by saying why I think things are how they are, and then I&amp;rsquo;ll get to the meat of my article.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;OBIEE in its current incarnation (v10.1.3) is a mature product. All the big bugs have been caught and fixed. All the known quirks are well documented. All the missing features are known. All the clever workarounds have been found. All the neat little hacks have been explored.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>OBIA grumble</title>
      <link>https://rmoff.net/2009/08/04/obia-grumble/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m starting on an upgrade from OBIA 7.9.5 to 7.9.6 and wading through the two main docs:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/E14223_01/bia.796/e14218.pdf&#34;&gt;7.9.6 Upgrade guide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/E14223_01/bia.796/e14217.pdf&#34;&gt;7.9.6 Installation guide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It would be nice if Oracle could come up with some less confusing terminology. It seems that not only is the whole product of OBIA referred to as OBIA (&lt;a href=&#34;http://siebel-essentials.blogspot.com/2009/06/can-you-describe-oracle-bi-applications.html&#34;&gt;see @lex&amp;rsquo;s posting for a good explanation&lt;/a&gt;), but that the sub-components which are not-OBIEE-or-DAC-or-Informatica is also OBIA, c.f. page 6-1 of the Upgrade guide &amp;ldquo;[&amp;hellip;]upgrade your Oracle BI Applications environment to the current version.&amp;rdquo; To me that implies that once I&amp;rsquo;ve done this, my OBIA will be upgraded - but no, actually, some of the supporting bits will be upgraded, but I still have to do a heck of a lot more grunt work before what I consider OBIA (and the manual is called OBIA too!) is upgraded.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>OTN forum rant</title>
      <link>https://rmoff.net/2009/07/21/otn-forum-rant/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I read and post a bit on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://forums.oracle.com/forums/forum.jspa?forumID=378&#34;&gt;OBIEE&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://forums.oracle.com/forums/forum.jspa?forumID=410&amp;amp;start=0&#34;&gt;OBIA&lt;/a&gt; OTN forums. The noise ratio isn&amp;rsquo;t too bad, but a few things really get my goat:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Not responding to answers!&lt;br&gt;&#xA;If I&amp;rsquo;ve gone out of my way to help, or try to help, at least have the courtesy to acknowledge it, and ideally mark as Helpful or Correct as appropriate.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Even a simple &amp;ldquo;thanks.&amp;rdquo; would do. It&amp;rsquo;s just good manners.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;It also helps people who come along afterwards as you get the completed picture rather than half a question/answer thread.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;http://forums.oracle.com/forums/ann.jspa?annID=939&#34;&gt;Forums Etiquette&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
