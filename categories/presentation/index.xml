      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s my presentation &amp;ldquo;Performance Testing and OBIEE&amp;rdquo; that I gave at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://rmoff.net/2010/05/21/rittmanmead-bi-forum-2010/&#34;&gt;RittmanMead BI Forum 2010&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://rnm1978.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/performance-testing-obiee.pptx&#34;&gt;Performance Testing and OBIEE.pptx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a Powerpoint 2007 file (pptx) for which you may need the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=048dc840-14e1-467d-8dca-19d2a8fd7485&amp;amp;displaylang=en&#34;&gt;Microsoft PowerPoint Viewer 2007&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;ve included copious notes on each slide which hopefully cover the gist of what I talked about when I was delivering it. There are also a handful of funky animations which is why I&amp;rsquo;ve left it in pptx and not exported to PDF or other format (sorry Open Office users).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>My first presentation - afterthoughts</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I delivered my first presentation today, at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rittmanmead.com/biforum2010/&#34;&gt;RittmanMead BI Forum&lt;/a&gt;.I was really nervous in the hours and minutes leading up to it, but once I got up there and started talking I actually quite enjoyed it. If you were in the audience, I&amp;rsquo;d love some feedback in the comments section below, particularly any &amp;ldquo;constructive criticism&amp;rdquo;. I obviously didn&amp;rsquo;t make too much of a mess of it, as I was awarded &amp;ldquo;best speaker&amp;rdquo; of the event, which was a great honour. Hopefully I&amp;rsquo;ll get the opportunity to present again soon, perhaps at an UKOUG event.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve just returned from the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rittmanmead.com/biforum2010/&#34;&gt;RittmanMead 2010 BI Forum&lt;/a&gt; which this year was at the Seattle Hotel in Brighton Marina.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://rnm1978.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/from-iphone-20100521-021.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://rnm1978.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/from-iphone-20100521-021.jpg?w=300&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;from iphone 20100521 021&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The event was limited to 50 attendees, and I think this was a good number. The event was explicitly pitched at a very technical expert level, and the audience very much represented this. Whereas at a larger conference you may find the odd manager wandering around pretending to be technical ;-) this event was most definitely not pitched at such types.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>My first presentation - help!</title>
      <link>https://rmoff.net/2010/04/21/my-first-presentation-help/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m doing my first ever conference presentation next month at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rittmanmead.com/biforum2010/&#34;&gt;2010 Rittman Mead BI Forum&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My presentation is called &lt;strong&gt;Performance Testing OBIEE&lt;/strong&gt;, which is something I&amp;rsquo;ve spent a lot of time working on over the last few months. I think the challenge is going to be distilling it all into a session that&amp;rsquo;s not going to overwhelm everyone or bore them to death! Well, actually, the challenge is going to be the presenting. I can talk geek one-on-one, but talking to a whole bunch of people, not wittering but staying focussed, holding their attention&amp;hellip;.uh oh.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
