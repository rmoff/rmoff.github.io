      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve written quite a few talks over the years, but usually as a side-line to my day job. In my role as a Developer Advocate, talks are part of What I Do, and so I can dedicate more time to it. A lot of the talks I&amp;#8217;ve done previously have evolved through numerous iterations, and with a new talk to deliver for the &#34;Spring Season&#34; of conferences, I thought it would be interesting to track what it took from concept to actual delivery.</description>

      <description>I write and speak lots about Kafka, and get a fair few questions from this. The most common question is actually nothing to do with Kafka, but instead:
 How do you make those cool diagrams?
 So here&amp;rsquo;s a short, and longer, answer!
tl;dr An iOS app called Paper, from a company called FiftyThree
So, how DO you make those cool diagrams? Disclaimer: This is a style that I have copied straight from my esteemed colleagues at Confluent, including Neha Narkhede and Ben Stopford, as well as others including Martin Kleppmann.</description>

      <title>Syntax highlighting code for presentation slides</title>

      <description>So you&amp;rsquo;ve got a code sample you want to share in a presentation, but whilst it looks beautiful in your text-editor with syntax highlighting, it&amp;rsquo;s fugly in Keynote? You could screenshot it and paste the image into your slide, but you just know that you&amp;rsquo;ll want to change that code, and end up re-snapshotting itâ€¦what a PITA.
Better to have a nicely syntax-highlighted code snippet that you can paste as formatted text into Keynote and amend from there as needed.</description>
