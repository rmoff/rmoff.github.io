      <description>I noticed on Nico&amp;rsquo;s wiki (which is amazing by the way, it has so much information in it) a bunch of additional parameters for nqcmd other than those which are displayed in the default helptext (nqcmd -h).
These are the additional ones: [sourcecode] -b -w&amp;lt;# wait seconds&amp;gt; -c&amp;lt;# cancel interval seconds&amp;gt; -n&amp;lt;# number of loops&amp;gt; -r&amp;lt;# number of requests per shared session&amp;gt; -t&amp;lt;# number of threads&amp;gt; -T (a flag to turn on time statistics) -SmartDiff (a flag to enable SmartDiff tags in output) -P -impersonate -runas [/sourcecode]</description>

      <description>Here are a couple of little unix scripts that I wrote whilst developing my performance testing OBIEE method.
They&amp;rsquo;re nothing particularly special, but may save you the couple of minutes it&amp;rsquo;d take to write them :)
Note that some of this data is available from Usage Tracking and where it is I&amp;rsquo;d recommend getting it from there, databases generally being easier to reliably and repeatably query than a transient log file.</description>

      <description>As a kid I loved the idea of lego where you can disassemble and reassemble something from the ground up. As soon as I got my hands on a computer it was the same. You can have your Acorn Archimedes with its games, where do I find the sprites and sound files behind it? Likewise Microsoft Word, let me at the VBA underneath to hack it around and see what else it can do.</description>
