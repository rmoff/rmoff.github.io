      <description>I’m quite a fan of Sonos audio equipment but recently had some trouble with some of the devices glitching and even cutting out whilst playing. Under the covers Sonos stuff is running Linux (of course) and exposes some diagnostics through a rudimentary frontend that you can access at http://&amp;lt;sonos player IP&amp;gt;:1400/support/review:
   Whilst this gives you the current state, you can’t get historical data on it. It felt like the problems were happening &amp;#34;all the time&amp;#34;, but were they actually?</description>
