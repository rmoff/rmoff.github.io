      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I do my best to try and keep, if not abreast of, then at least aware of what’s going on in the world of data. That includes RDBMS, Event streaming, stream processing, open source data projects, data engineering, object storage, and more. If you’re interested in the same, then you might find this blog useful, because I’m sharing my sources :)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do you try and stay current on technical affairs, given only 24 hours in a day and a job to do as well? Here&amp;rsquo;s my take on it&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of the many things that has changed perceptibly since the beginning of this century when I started working in IT is the amount of information freely available, and being created all the time. Back then, printed books and manuals were still the primary source of definitive information about a piece of software. Remember these? I bet you still have a few of them keeping your monitor at the right height still&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
