      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started my dbt journey by &lt;a href=&#34;https://rmoff.net/2022/10/20/data-engineering-in-2022-exploring-dbt-with-duckdb/&#34;&gt;poking and pulling at the pre-built jaffle_shop demo running with DuckDB as its data store&lt;/a&gt;. Now I want to see if I can put it to use myself to wrangle the session feedback data that came in from &lt;a href=&#34;https://2022.currentevent.io/&#34;&gt;Current 2022&lt;/a&gt;. Iâ€™ve &lt;a href=&#34;https://rmoff.net/2022/10/14/current-22-session-analysis-with-duckdb-and-jupyter-notebook/&#34;&gt;analysed&lt;/a&gt; this already, but it struck me that a particular part of it would benefit from some tidying up - and be a good excuse to see what itâ€™s like using dbt to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iâ€™ve been wanting to try out dbt for some time now, and a recent long-haul flight seemed like the obvious opportunity to do so. Except many of the tutorials with dbt that I found were based on using Cloud, and airplane WiFi is generally sucky or non-existant. Then I found the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/dbt-labs/jaffle_shop_duckdb&#34;&gt;DuckDB-based demo of dbt&lt;/a&gt;, which seemed to fit the bill (ðŸ¦† geddit?!) perfectly, since DuckDB runs locally. In addition, &lt;a href=&#34;https://duckdb.org/&#34;&gt;DuckDB&lt;/a&gt; had appeared on my radar recently and I was keen to check it out.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Data Engineering in 2022: Architectures &amp; Terminology</title>

      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of those &lt;em&gt;you had to be there&lt;/em&gt; moments. If you come into the world of data and analytics engineering today, ELT is just what it is and is pretty much universally understood. But if youâ€™ve been around for â€¦&lt;em&gt;waves hands&lt;/em&gt;â€¦ longer than that, you might be confused by what people are calling ELT and ETL. Well, I was âœ‹.&lt;/p&gt;
