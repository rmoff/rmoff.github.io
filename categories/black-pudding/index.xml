      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had the pleasure of not one but two fry-ups in York, UK last weekend.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first was courtesy of &lt;a href=&#34;https://bills-website.co.uk/&#34;&gt;Bill&amp;rsquo;s Restaurant&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://rmoff.net/images/2016/05/CjDJFSBWYAAt6W3-jpg-large.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Fry Up at Bill&amp;rsquo;s Restaurant&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Overall, pretty good, and I&amp;rsquo;ve had much worse. All the ingredients seemed decent. The black pudding was overcooked and almost biscuit-like, but that&amp;rsquo;s my only serious grumble. The bacon was cooked well. That black pudding, beans and the mashed/friend potato thing were each extra charges annoyed me. Particularly with a hangover, I just want to be able to order a full english, without playing &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)&#34;&gt;Mastermind&lt;/a&gt; to work out what&amp;rsquo;s in or not.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the perks of my job is that I get to travel to some pretty nice places (hi, San Francisco, Bergen, Åland Islands), and get to eat some pretty good food too. If you&amp;rsquo;re looking for some techie content, then move along and go and read about &lt;a href=&#34;https://rmoff.net/2016/03/16/fun-and-games-with-oracle-goldengate-kafka-and-logstash-on-bigdatalite-4.4/&#34;&gt;Kafka&lt;/a&gt;, but if you enjoy food pr0n then stay put.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was working for a client in the centre of Manchester this week, staying as usual at a Premier Inn. I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of my &lt;a href=&#34;https://rmoff.net/2016/02/26/what-makes-a-good-full-english/&#34;&gt;fried breakfasts&lt;/a&gt;, and whilst never anything to write home about (or indeed write a blog about) Premier Inn breakfasts are generally fine for what they are &amp;ndash; but this one was a real disappointment. Even with the excitement of seeing &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_and_squeak&#34;&gt;bubble and squeak&lt;/a&gt;, it was a real let down; luke warm, and the sausages in particular tasted really artificially flavoured.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
