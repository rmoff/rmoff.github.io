      <description>Why? I&amp;#8217;ve been blogging for quite a few years now, starting on Blogger, soon onto WordPress, and then to Ghost a couple of years ago. Blogger was fairly lame, WP yucky, but I really do like Ghost. It&amp;#8217;s simple and powerful and was perfect for my needs. My needs being, an outlet for technical content that respected formatting, worked with a markup language (Markdown), and didn&amp;#8217;t f**k things up in the way that WP often would in its WYSIWYG handling of content.</description>
