      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blog is written in Asciidoc, built using Hugo, and hosted on GitHub Pages. I recently wanted to share the draft of a post I was writing with someone and ended up exporting a local preview to a PDF - not a great workflow! This blog post shows you how to create an automagic hosted preview of any draft content on Hugo using GitHub Actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is useful for previewing and sharing one’s own content, but also for making good use of GitHub as a collaborative platform - if someone &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rmoff/rmoff-blog/pull/4#pullrequestreview-933907051&#34;&gt;reviews and amends your PR&lt;/a&gt; the post gets updated in the preview too.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years I’ve used various blogging platforms; after a brief dalliance with Blogger I started for real with the near-inevitable Wordpress.com. From there I decided it would be fun to self-host using Ghost, and then almost &lt;a href=&#34;https://rmoff.net/2018/12/17/moving-from-ghost-to-hugo/&#34;&gt;exactly two years ago to the day&lt;/a&gt; decided it definitely was not fun to spend time patching and upgrading my blog platform instead of writing blog articles, so headed over to my current platform of choice: Hugo hosted on GitHub pages. This has worked extremely well for me during that time, doing everything I want from it until recently.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Moving from Ghost to Hugo</title>

      <description>Why? I’ve been blogging for quite a few years now, starting on Blogger, soon onto WordPress, and then to Ghost a couple of years ago. Blogger was fairly lame, WP yucky, but I really do like Ghost. It’s simple and powerful and was perfect for my needs. My needs being, an outlet for technical content that respected formatting, worked with a markup language (Markdown), and didn’t f**k things up in the way that WP often would in its WYSIWYG handling of content.</description>

      <description>So the last post here was in 2011…seven years later I should probably post again, just to point random Google visitors to :
