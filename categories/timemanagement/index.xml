      <description>A brilliant posting here from Jonathan Lewis on the subject of Experts. He in turn is quoting Chen Shapira: &amp;ldquo;DBAs are under a lot of pressure not to be experts.&amp;rdquo;. Read the sentence again, as it took me a minute to figure out.

      <description>I found this post very interesting: Paul Graham : Maker&amp;rsquo;s Schedule, Manager&amp;rsquo;s Schedule (originally found here)
It was one of those mini-revelations when I found something that greatly resonated and explained an inexplicable frustration I find in the workplace sometimes.
I wonder how applicable it can be to a large corporation though, rather than a start-up where it&amp;rsquo;s given that people are allowed to be bolshy with their meetings? ;-)</description>
