      <description>In this article I demonstrated how to use KSQL to filter streams of network event data. As well as filtering, KSQL can be used to easily enrich streams. In this article we&amp;rsquo;ll see how this enriched data can be used to drive analysis in Elasticsearch and Kibanaâ€”and how KSQL again came into use for building some stream processing as a result of the discovery made.
