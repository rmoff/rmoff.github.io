      <description>This is revisiting the blog I wrote a while back, which showed using mongodump and mongorestore to copy a MongoDB database from one machine (a Unifi CloudKey) to another. This time instead of a manual lift and shift, I wanted a simple way to automate the update of the target with changes made on the source.
 The source is as before, Unifi’s CloudKey, which runs MongoDB to store its data about the network - devices, access points, events, and so on.</description>

      <description>In this article I demonstrated how to use KSQL to filter streams of network event data. As well as filtering, KSQL can be used to easily enrich streams. In this article we&amp;rsquo;ll see how this enriched data can be used to drive analysis in Elasticsearch and Kibana—and how KSQL again came into use for building some stream processing as a result of the discovery made.
The data came from my home Ubiquiti router, and took two forms:</description>

      <description>DISCLAIMER: I am not a MongoDB person (even if it is Web Scale X-D) - below instructions may work for you, they may not. Use with care!
For some work I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing I wanted to access the data in Ubiquiti&amp;rsquo;s Unifi controller which it stores in MongoDB. Because I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to risk my actual Unifi device by changing local settings to enable remote access, and also because the version of MongoDB on it is older than ideal, I wanted to clone the data elsewhere.</description>
