&lt;p&gt;I do my best to try and keep, if not abreast of, then at least aware of what’s going on in the world of data. That includes RDBMS, Event streaming, stream processing, open source data projects, data engineering, object storage, and more. If you’re interested in the same, then you might find this blog useful, because I’m sharing my sources :)&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My background is not a traditional CompSci one. I studied Music at university, and managed to wangle my way into IT through various means, ending up doing what I do now with no formal training in coding, and a grab-bag of hacky programming attempts on my CV. My weapons of choice have been BBC Basic, VBA, ASP, and more recently some very unpythonic-Python. It’s got me by, but I figured recently I’d like to learn something new, and several people pointed to Go as a good option.&lt;/p&gt;
