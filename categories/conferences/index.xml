      <title>Are Tech Conferences Dead?</title>

      <description>ðŸ¦ COVID-19 has well and truly hit the tech scene this week. As well as being full of &amp;#34;WFH tips&amp;#34; for all the tech workers suddenly banished from their offices, my particular Twitter bubble is full of DevRel folk musing and debating about what this interruption means to our profession. For sure, in the short term, the Spring conference season is screwedâ€” all the conferences are cancelled (or postponed).
 But what about the future?</description>

      <description>Just over a year ago, I put together the crudely-titled &amp;#34;Quick Thoughts on Not Writing a Crap Abstract&amp;#34; after reviewing a few dozen conference abstracts. This time around Iâ€™ve had the honour of being on a conference programme committee and with it the pleasure of reading 250+ abstractsâ€”from which I have some more snarky words of wisdom to impart on the matter.
 Remind meâ€¦how does this conference game work? Before we really get into it, letâ€™s recap how this whole game works, because plenty of people are new to conference speaking.</description>

      <description>Iâ€™ve had a relaxing couple of weeks off work over the summer, and came back today to realise that Iâ€™ve got a fair bit of conference and meetup travel to wrap my head around for the next few months :)
 If youâ€™re interested in where Iâ€™ll be and want to come and say hi, hear about Kafkaâ€”or just grab a coffee or beer, herewith my itinerary as it currently stands.</description>

      <title>Quick Thoughts on Not Making a Crap Slide Deck</title>
      <link>https://rmoff.net/2019/03/19/quick-thoughts-on-not-making-a-crap-slide-deck/</link>

      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post is the companion to an earlier one that I wrote about &lt;a href=&#34;https://rmoff.net/2018/12/19/quick-thoughts-on-not-writing-a-crap-abstract/&#34;&gt;conference abstracts&lt;/a&gt;. In the same way that the last one was inspired by reviewing a ton of abstracts and noticing a recurring pattern in my suggestions, so this one comes from reviewing a bunch of slide decks for a forthcoming conference. They all look like good talks, but in several cases &lt;em&gt;these great talks are fighting to get out from underneath the deadening weight of slides&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herewith follows my highly-opinionated, fairly-subjective, and extremely-terse advice and general suggestions for slide decks. You can also find relating ramblings in &lt;a href=&#34;https://rmoff.net/2019/03/01/preparing-a-new-talk/&#34;&gt;this recent post&lt;/a&gt; too. My friend and colleague Vik Gamov also wrote &lt;a href=&#34;https://gamov.io/posts/2019/03/15/quick-tips-on-designing-your-next-presentation.html&#34;&gt;a good post&lt;/a&gt; on this same topic, and linked to &lt;a href=&#34;https://player.oreilly.com/videos/9781491954980&#34;&gt;a good video&lt;/a&gt; that Iâ€™d recommend you watch.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Iâ€™ve reviewed a bunch of abstracts in the last couple of days, here are some common suggestions I made:
   No need to include your company name in the abstract text. Chances are Iâ€™ve not heard of your company, and even if I have, what does it add to my comprehension of your abstract and what youâ€™re going to talk about? Possible exception would be the &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; tech companies where people will see a talk just because itâ€™s Netflix etc</description>
