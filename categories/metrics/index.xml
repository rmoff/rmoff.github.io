      <description>InfluxDB is a great time series database, that&amp;rsquo;s recently been rebranded as part of the &amp;ldquo;TICK&amp;rdquo; stack, including data collectors, visualisation, and ETL/Alerting. I&amp;rsquo;ve yet to really look at the other components, but InfluxDB alone works just great with my favourite visualisation/analysis tool for time series metrics, Grafana.
Getting data into InfluxDB is easy, with many tools supporting the native InfluxDB line input protocol, and those that don&amp;rsquo;t often supporting the carbon protocol (from Graphite), which InfluxDB also supports (along with others).</description>

      <description>It struck me today when I was writing my most recent blog over at Rittman Mead that I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing with visualising OBIEE metrics for years now.
 Back in 2009 I wrote about using something called JManage to pull metrics out of OBIEE 10g via JMX:
 Still with OBIEE 10g in 2011, I was using rrdtool and some horrible-looking tcl hacking to get the metrics out through jmx :</description>
