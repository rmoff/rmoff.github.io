      <description>I began travelling for my job when my first child was three months old. But don’t mistake correlation for causation…it wasn’t the broken nights&amp;#39; sleep that forced me onto the road, but an excellent job opportunity that seemed worth the risk. Nearly eight years later and I’m in a different job but still with a bunch of travel involved. How much I travel has varied. It’s tended to average around 30%, but has peaked at way more than that.</description>
