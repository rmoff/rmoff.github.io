      <title>Antora Deployment to Cloudflare Across Private Repositories with GitHub Actions</title>

      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href=&#34;https://decodable.co&#34;&gt;Decodable&lt;/a&gt; we migrated our docs platform onto &lt;a href=&#34;https://antora.org/&#34;&gt;Antora&lt;/a&gt;. I wrote &lt;a href=&#34;https://rmoff.net/2023/12/19/deploying-antora-with-github-actions-and-a-private-github-repo/&#34;&gt;previously&lt;/a&gt; about my escapades in getting cross-repository authentication working using &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#types-of-personal-access-tokens&#34;&gt;Private Access Tokens&lt;/a&gt; (PAT). These are fine for just a single user, but theyâ€™re tied to that user, which isnâ€™t a good practice for deployment in this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article Iâ€™ll show how to use GitHub Apps and Installation Access Tokens (IAT) instead, and go into some detail on how weâ€™ve deployed Antora. Our GitHub repositories are private which makes it extra-gnarly.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A friend messaged me late last night with the scary news that Google had emailed him about a ton of spammy subdomains on his own domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;imageblock&#34;&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;content&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://rmoff.net/images/2024/01/g1.webp&#34; alt=&#34;A list of spam domains as reported by Google&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Any idea how this could have happened, he asked?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Deploying Antora with GitHub Actions and a private GitHub repo</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://antora.org/&#34;&gt;Antora&lt;/a&gt; is a modern documentation site generator with many nice features including sourcing documentation content from one or more separate git repositories. This means that your docs can be kept under source control (yay ðŸŽ‰) and in sync with the code of the product that they are documenting (double yay ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you would expect for a documentation tool, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.antora.org/antora/latest/&#34;&gt;Antora documentation&lt;/a&gt; is thorough but there was one sharp edge involving GitHub that caught me out which I&amp;rsquo;ll detail here.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Using GitHub Actions to build automagic Hugo previews of draft articles</title>
      <link>https://rmoff.net/2022/04/06/using-github-actions-to-build-automagic-hugo-previews-of-draft-articles/</link>

      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blog is written in Asciidoc, built using Hugo, and hosted on GitHub Pages. I recently wanted to share the draft of a post I was writing with someone and ended up exporting a local preview to a PDF - not a great workflow! This blog post shows you how to create an automagic hosted preview of any draft content on Hugo using GitHub Actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is useful for previewing and sharing oneâ€™s own content, but also for making good use of GitHub as a collaborative platform - if someone &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rmoff/rmoff-blog/pull/4#pullrequestreview-933907051&#34;&gt;reviews and amends your PR&lt;/a&gt; the post gets updated in the preview too.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Scheduling Hugo Builds on GitHub pages with GitHub Actions</title>

      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years Iâ€™ve used various blogging platforms; after a brief dalliance with Blogger I started for real with the near-inevitable Wordpress.com. From there I decided it would be fun to self-host using Ghost, and then almost &lt;a href=&#34;https://rmoff.net/2018/12/17/moving-from-ghost-to-hugo/&#34;&gt;exactly two years ago to the day&lt;/a&gt; decided it definitely was not fun to spend time patching and upgrading my blog platform instead of writing blog articles, so headed over to my current platform of choice: Hugo hosted on GitHub pages. This has worked extremely well for me during that time, doing everything I want from it until recently.&lt;/p&gt;
