&lt;p&gt;Whilst Apache Kafka is an event streaming platform designed for, well, &lt;em&gt;streams&lt;/em&gt; of events, it’s perfectly valid to use it as a store of data which perhaps changes only occasionally (or even never). I’m thinking here of reference data (lookup data) that’s used to enrich regular streams of events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might well get your reference data from a database where it resides and do so effectively &lt;a href=&#34;https://rmoff.dev/no-more-silos&#34;&gt;using CDC&lt;/a&gt; - but sometimes it comes down to those pesky CSV files that we all know and love/hate. Simple, awful, but effective. I wrote previously about &lt;a href=&#34;https://rmoff.net/2020/06/17/loading-csv-data-into-kafka/&#34;&gt;loading CSV data into Kafka from files that are updated frequently&lt;/a&gt;, but here I want to look at CSV files that are not changing. Kafka Connect simplifies getting data in to (and out of) Kafka but even Kafka Connect becomes a bit of an overhead when you just have a single file that you want to load into a topic and then never deal with again. I spent this afternoon wrangling with a couple of CSV-ish files, and building on my previous article about &lt;a href=&#34;https://rmoff.net/2021/02/02/performing-a-group-by-on-data-in-bash/&#34;&gt;neat tricks you can do in bash with data&lt;/a&gt;, I have some more to share with you here :)&lt;/p&gt;
