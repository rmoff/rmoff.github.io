      <description>On a family holiday in South Devon last week I had some good food experiences. Top of the pile was a Lardy Cake, a delicacy new to me but which I&amp;rsquo;ll be sure to be searching out again. It reminded me of an Eccles cake, but bigger and lardier!
I got mine from Vinnicombes on the High Street in Sidmouth.
Just down the coast from Sidmouth is a village called Beer.</description>
