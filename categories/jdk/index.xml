      <description>I got this lovely failure during a fresh install of OBIEE 11.1.1.9. I emphasise that it was during the install because there&amp;rsquo;s other causes for this error on an existing system to do with corrupted credential stores etc &amp;ndash; not the case here.
The install had copied in the binaries and was in the process of building the domain. During the early stages of this where it starts configuring and restarting the AdminServer it failed, with the AdminServer.</description>
