      <description>Very interesting post by Kevin McGinley about CAF here:Â CAF = Migration Utility? Use Caution!
It articulates better than I ever could reasons against using CAF particularly in a production environment.
Since the tool came out I&amp;rsquo;d been struggling to get my head around it, convinced I was missing something. I still don&amp;rsquo;t profess to understand it properly, but Kevin&amp;rsquo;s article reassures me that I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be losing too much sleep over it, especially given that it&amp;rsquo;s unsupported and won&amp;rsquo;t work with 11g.</description>

      <description>Christian Screen has done a nice video explaining the CAF installation, and has promised a deep-dive followup which I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to. Click here for the article</description>

      <title>CAF troubles</title>

      <description>Following the Oracle CAF tutorial here, I got to Cloning Answers Requests section and then got stuck. I&amp;rsquo;d set up my environment exactly the same as in the tutorial, down to the same paths etc. After firing up the CAF to clone requests from the SampleSales catalog: I clicked on Next and got the error &amp;ldquo;Exception occurred when while initializing repository!!!&amp;rdquo;
By playing around with the passwords and path names I determined that both RPD files existed and that CAF could load them enough to validate the passwords.</description>
