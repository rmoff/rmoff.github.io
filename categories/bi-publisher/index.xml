      <title>BI Publisher - error creating Quartz tables</title>

      <description>A very short blog post to break the drought, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t hit any google results for this error so thought it might be useful to record it.
In BI Publisher 10.1.3.4, trying to install the Scheduler (Quartz) schema, I got this error:
[sourcecode]Schema installation failed while creating tables. Schema may already exist. Please remove the existing schema or choose another database and try again.[/sourcecode]
To me, the error text is a bit unhelpful.</description>

      <description>Follow on from setting up Publisher in a clustered environment, I&amp;rsquo;ve found a nasty little bug in the scheduling element of Publisher, Quartz.
Looking at the oc4j log file /opmn/logs/default_group~home~default_group~1.log I can see OC4J starting up, and then a whole load of repeated messages:
09/03/30 11:28:43 Oracle Containers for J2EE 10g (10.1.3.3.0) initialized
- ClusterManager: detected 1 failed or restarted instances.
- ClusterManager: Scanning for instance &amp;ldquo;myserver.fqdn.company.net1238408921404&amp;rdquo;&amp;rsquo;s failed in-progress jobs.</description>

      <title>Clustering Publisher - Scheduler and Report Repository</title>

      <description>The Oracle BI Publisher Enterprise Cluster Deployment doc which I just found through Metalink highlighted a couple of points:
- Report repository should be shared
- The scheduler should be configured for a cluster
Report Repository
Through Admin&amp;gt;System Maintenance&amp;gt;Report Repository I changed the path from the default, /xmlp/XMLP to a NFS mount data/shared/xmlp and restarted the xmlpserver application in OAS. On coming back up Publisher complained because all its config files (in xmlp/Admin), had disappeared.</description>

      <title>Which jdbc driver to use</title>

      <guid>https://rmoff.net/2009/03/24/which-jdbc-driver-to-use/</guid>
      <description>In setting the scheduler in Publisher I discovered a useful difference in jdbc drivers.
Our repository is on Oracle 11g.
According to the manual oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver should be used, but previous installations have used oracle.bi.jdbc.AnaJdbcDriver so I tried this too.
In experimenting with both I found you get more useful feedback from the second one. Here&amp;rsquo;s the same problem reported by both drivers:
Â· Exception [TOPLINK-4002] (Oracle TopLink - 11g Release 1 (11.</description>

      <title>Finding config files in unix</title>

      <description>Following my previous work on configuring Publisher, I wanted to note down where the changes were written to.
The -mname syntax of the unix find command comes in handy here:
find /app/oracle/product/obiee -mtime -1
Shows me all files under the specified path which were modified in the last 1 day
and helpfully throws up:
/app/oracle/product/obiee/xmlp/XMLP/Admin/DataSource/datasources.xml</description>

      <title>OBIEE Publisher - configuring connection to clustered BI Server</title>
      <link>https://rmoff.net/2009/03/23/obiee-publisher-configuring-connection-to-clustered-bi-server/</link>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m setting up a clustered OBIEE 10.1.3.4 production environment. There are four servers; two BI Server + Cluster Controller + Scheduler and two OAS + Presentation Services + Publisher. Clustering of BI is configured, now I&amp;rsquo;m setting up the other bits. Today is Publisher.
On publisher instance A connections to the BI Servers directly work fine:
jdbc:oraclebi://serverA.fqdn.company.net:9703/ jdbc:oraclebi://serverB.fqdn.company.net:9703/
both work individually as Connection Strings (with database driver class of oracle.bi.jdbc.AnaJdbcDriver) - verified with &amp;ldquo;Test Connection&amp;rdquo; button.</description>
