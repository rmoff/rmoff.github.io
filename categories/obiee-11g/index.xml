      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s not my fault really.
When running an installation, presented with the option of
 (a) do a bunch of stuff and wait to continue the install later or (b) tick a box and continue now  it&amp;rsquo;s a better man that I who would opt for option (a).
When I recently installed OBIEE 11g, I was prompted to get a script run as root to set up the inventory, or tick &amp;ldquo;Continue Installation with local inventory&amp;rdquo; to continue with the install.</description>

      <description>OBIEE 11g is going to be officially launched on 7th July (this year!) in London: Launch Event: Introducing Oracle Business Intelligence Enterprise Edition 11g
h/t to Twitter and blogs (including an Oracle-branded one) this morning. Good news travels fast! :-)
Looks like John Minkjan won the bet, did he know something we didn&amp;rsquo;t? ;-) (although is &amp;ldquo;Launch&amp;rdquo; the same as &amp;ldquo;GA&amp;rdquo;?)</description>

      <description>Spotted this when trawling through My Oracle Support. It&amp;rsquo;s pretty common knowledge anyway amongst people already familiar with hacking around with OBIEE, but worth recording for people coming along to it new.
Doc ID 1068266.1 states:
 UDML is not supported in OBI 10g.
in 11g, XUDML (the Oracle BI Server XML API) will be fully supported and documented.

      <title>OBIEE application servers, now and future</title>

      <description>Oracle have published an interesting doc 968223.1, entitled &amp;ldquo;Enterprise Deployment of Oracle BI EE on OC4J and App Servers&amp;rdquo;.
It details the differences between OC4J and OAS which is useful for the current versions of OBIEE. It then also gives a useful heads-up &amp;ndash; that WebLogic becomes the App server of choice in the next version of OBIEE
 All of this changes in OBI EE 11g where several projects will become absolutely dependent upon an App Server.</description>
