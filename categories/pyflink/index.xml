      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I started &lt;a href=&#34;https://rmoff.net/categories/laf/&#34;&gt;my journey learning Apache Flink&lt;/a&gt; one of the things that several people expressed an interest in hearing more about was PyFlink.  This appeals to me too, because whilst Java is just something I don&amp;rsquo;t know and feels beyond me to try and learn, Python is something that I know enough of to at least hack my way around it. I&amp;rsquo;ve previously &lt;a href=&#34;https://rmoff.net/2022/09/16/data-engineering-in-2022-exploring-lakefs-with-jupyter-and-pyspark/&#34;&gt;had fun with PySpark&lt;/a&gt;, and whilst &lt;a href=&#34;https://rmoff.net/categories/flink-sql/&#34;&gt;Flink SQL&lt;/a&gt; will probably be one of my main focusses, I also want to get a feel for PyFlink.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first step to using PyFlink is installing it - which should be simple, right?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
