      <description>&lt;p&gt;With my new server I bought a UPS, partly just as a Good Thing, but also because I suspect a powercut fried the motherboard on a previous machine that I had, and this baby is too precious to lose ;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The idea is that the UPS will smooth out the power supply to my server, protecting it from surges or temporarily blips in power loss. If there&amp;rsquo;s a proper power cut, the UPS is connected to my server and can initiate a graceful shutdown instead of system crash. It seems unintuitive in this day and age of laptops and iPads that you just close or switch off to &amp;ldquo;suspend&amp;rdquo; them that killing the power to a server can damage it, but when you think about it just a moment more, it&amp;rsquo;s hardly surprising.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
