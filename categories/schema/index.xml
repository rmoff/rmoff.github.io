      <description>This was prompted by a question on StackOverflow to which I thought the answer would be straightforward, but turned out not to be so. And then I got a bit carried away and ended up with a nice example of how you can handle schema-less data coming from a system such as RabbitMQ and apply a schema to it.
   Note  This same pattern for ingesting bytes and applying a schema will work with other connectors such as MQTT     What?</description>
