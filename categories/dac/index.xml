      <description>What&amp;rsquo;s going on here? The username/password is definitely valid, proved by the sqlplus connection.

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s a set of scripts that I use on our servers as a quick way to check if the various BI components are up and running.
Because we split the stack across servers, there are different scripts called in combination. On our dev boxes we have everything and so the script calls all three sub-scripts, whereas on Production each server will run one of:
 BI Server Presentation Server &amp;amp; OAS Informatica &amp;amp; DAC  The scripts source another script called process_check.</description>

      <title>OBIA upgrade 7.9.5 to 7.9.6 - first thoughts</title>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re upgrading from OBIA 7.9.5 (Financials - GL) to OBIA 7.9.6. Our reasons are for support (7.9.5 does not support Oracle 11g) and minor functionality additions.
Our architecture is: HP-UX 64 bit Itanium (11.31), Oracle 11g (11.1.0.7), separate ETL server, 4x OBIEE servers (2x BI, 2xPS). We have no customisations in the ETL except something for budgets, which is superseded in 7.9.6.
This post is a semi-formed articulation of my frustrations encountered during an initial run through of the upgrade in a sandbox.</description>

      <title>Mark Rittman&#39;s OBIEE repository for DAC</title>

      <description>Mark Rittman has an excellent article about querying the DAC repository database tables, including a downloadable RPD file. Being new to working with RPDs I thought it would be good practise to explore this as well as hopefully get some useful information about our current ETL deployment.
I downloaded the RPD to c:\OracleBI\server\Repository and opened it up in the Admin tool (Administrator/Administrator).
First off I changed the connection pool to point to my DAC repository database, having setup a TNS entry for it first.</description>
