      <description>Last month I wrote about a problem that Informatica as part of OBIA was causing us, wherein an expired database account would bring Oracle down by virtue of multiple connections from Informatica.
I raised an SR with Oracle (under OBIA support), who after some back-and-forth with Informatica, were told:
This is not a bug. That the two error messages coming back from Oracle are handled differently is the result of a design decision and as such not a product fault.</description>

      <description>This problem, which in essence is bad behaviour from Informatica bringing down Oracle, is a good illustration of unintended consequences of an apparently innocuous security setting. Per our company&amp;rsquo;s security standards, database passwords expire every 90 days. When this happens users are prompted to change their password before they can continue logging into Oracle.

      <description>The latest point release of Oracle Business Intelligence Applications, 7.9.6.1, has been released and is available for download from here (direct link to download).
The version.txt reports the version as:
Build: 7.9.6.1.100609.2038 Release Version: Oracle Business Intelligence Applications 7.9.6.1 Package: 100609.2038
No updated documentation library yet through, so can&amp;rsquo;t nosey through the release notes. The docs that come with the download are labelled 7.9.6 and dated April 09 so don&amp;rsquo;t look like they&amp;rsquo;ve been updated either.</description>
