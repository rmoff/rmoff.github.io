      <description>&lt;p&gt;With my &lt;a href=&#34;https://rmoff.net/2022/09/14/stretching-my-legs-in-the-data-engineering-ecosystem-in-2022/&#34;&gt;foray&lt;/a&gt; into the current world of data engineering I wanted to get my hands dirty with some of the tools and technologies I&amp;rsquo;d been reading about. The vehicle for this was trying to understand more about LakeFS, but along the way dabbling with PySpark and S3 (MinIO) too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d forgotten how amazingly useful notebooks are. It&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rittmanmead.com/blog/2016/12/etl-offload-with-spark-and-amazon-emr-part-2-code-development-with-notebooks-and-docker/&#34;&gt;six years since I wrote about them last&lt;/a&gt; (and the last time I tried my hand at PySpark). This blog is basically the notebook, with some more annotations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Data Engineering in 2022: Storage and Access</title>

      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article I look at where we store our analytical data, how we organise it, and how we enable access to it. I’m considering here potentially large volumes of data for access throughout an organisation. I’m not looking at data stores that are used for specific purposes (caches, low-latency analytics, graph etc).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article is &lt;a href=&#34;https://rmoff.net/2022/09/14/stretching-my-legs-in-the-data-engineering-ecosystem-in-2022/&#34;&gt;part of a series&lt;/a&gt; in which I explore the world of data engineering in 2022 and how it has changed from when I started my career in data warehousing 20+ years ago. Read the &lt;a href=&#34;https://rmoff.net/2022/09/14/stretching-my-legs-in-the-data-engineering-ecosystem-in-2022/&#34;&gt;introduction&lt;/a&gt; for more context and background.&lt;/p&gt;
