      <title>Disabling Vale Linting Selectively in Asciidoc</title>

      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m a &lt;strong&gt;HUGE&lt;/strong&gt; fan of Docs as Code in general, and specifically tools like &lt;a href=&#34;https://vale.sh&#34;&gt;Vale&lt;/a&gt; that lint your prose for adherence to style rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that had been bugging me though was how to selectively disable Vale for particular sections of a document.
Usually linting issues should be addressed at root: either fix the prose, or update the style rule. Either it’s a rule, or it’s not, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes though I’ve found a need to make a particular exception to a rule, or simply needed to skip linting for a particular file.
I was struggling with how to do this in Asciidoc.
Despite &lt;a href=&#34;https://vale.sh/docs/topics/config/#asciidoc&#34;&gt;the documentation&lt;/a&gt; showing how to, I could never get it to work reliably.
Now I’ve taken some time to dig into it, I think I’ve finally understood :)&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>I use Hugo for my blog, hosted on GitHub pages. One of the reasons I’m really happy with it is that I can use Asciidoc to author my posts. I was writing a blog recently in which I wanted to include some code that’s hosted on GitHub. I could have copied &amp;amp; pasted it into the blog but that would be lame!
With Asciidoc you can use the include:: directive to include both local files:</description>

      <description>Updated 16 April 2020 to cover formatting tricks &amp;amp; add import to Google Docs info
Short and sweet this one. I’ve written in the past how I love Markdown but I’ve actually moved on from that and now firmly throw my hat in the AsciiDoc ring. I’ll write another post another time explaining why in more detail, but in short it’s just more powerful whilst still simple and readable without compilation.</description>

      <title>Moving from Ghost to Hugo</title>

      <description>Why? I’ve been blogging for quite a few years now, starting on Blogger, soon onto WordPress, and then to Ghost a couple of years ago. Blogger was fairly lame, WP yucky, but I really do like Ghost. It’s simple and powerful and was perfect for my needs. My needs being, an outlet for technical content that respected formatting, worked with a markup language (Markdown), and didn’t f**k things up in the way that WP often would in its WYSIWYG handling of content.</description>
