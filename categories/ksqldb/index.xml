      <title>Adventures in the Cloud, Part 94: ECS</title>

      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My name&amp;#8217;s Robin, and I&amp;#8217;m a Developer Advocate. What that means in part is that I build a ton of demos, and Docker Compose is my jam. I love using Docker Compose for the same reasons that many people do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;ulist&#34;&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spin up and tear down fully-functioning multi-component environments with ease. No bespoke builds, no cloning of VMs to preserve &#34;that magic state where everything works&#34;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repeatability. It&amp;#8217;s the same each time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Portability. I can point someone at a &lt;code&gt;docker-compose.yml&lt;/code&gt; that I&amp;#8217;ve written and they can run the same on their machine with the same results almost guaranteed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Primitive Keys in ksqlDB</title>
      <link>https://rmoff.net/2020/02/07/primitive-keys-in-ksqldb/</link>

      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ksqlDB 0.7 will add support for message keys as primitive data types beyond just &lt;code&gt;STRING&lt;/code&gt; (which is all we&amp;#8217;ve had to date). That means that Kafka messages are going to be much easier to work with, and require less wrangling to get into the form in which you need them. Take an example of a database table that you&amp;#8217;ve ingested into a Kafka topic, and want to join to a stream of events. Previously you&amp;#8217;d have had to take the Kafka topic into which the table had been ingested and run a ksqlDB processor to re-key the messages such that ksqlDB could join on them. &lt;em&gt;Friends, I am here to tell you that this is no longer needed!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Monitoring Sonos with ksqlDB, InfluxDB, and Grafana</title>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;m quite a fan of Sonos audio equipment but recently had some trouble with some of the devices glitching and even cutting out whilst playing. Under the covers Sonos stuff is running Linux (of course) and exposes some diagnostics through a rudimentary frontend that you can access at http://&amp;lt;sonos player IP&amp;gt;:1400/support/review:
   Whilst this gives you the current state, you can&amp;#8217;t get historical data on it. It felt like the problems were happening &#34;</description>

      <title>Exploring ksqlDB window start time</title>
      <link>https://rmoff.net/2020/01/09/exploring-ksqldb-window-start-time/</link>

      <description>Prompted by a question on StackOverflow I had a bit of a dig into how windows behave in ksqlDB, specifically with regards to their start time. This article shows also how to create test data in ksqlDB and create data to be handled with a timestamp in the past.
 For a general background to windowing in ksqlDB see the excellent docs.
 The nice thing about recent releases of ksqlDB/KSQL is that you can create and populate streams directly with CREATE STREAM and INSERT INTO respectively.</description>

      <title>Streaming messages from RabbitMQ into Kafka with Kafka Connect</title>

      <description>This was prompted by a question on StackOverflow to which I thought the answer would be straightforward, but turned out not to be so. And then I got a bit carried away and ended up with a nice example of how you can handle schema-less data coming from a system such as RabbitMQ and apply a schema to it.
   Note  This same pattern for ingesting bytes and applying a schema will work with other connectors such as JMS, MQTT, and ActiveMQ etc     What?</description>

      <title>Analysing network behaviour with ksqlDB and MongoDB</title>

      <description>In this post I want to build on my previous one and show another use of the Syslog data that I&amp;#8217;m capturing. Instead of looking for SSH attacks, I&amp;#8217;m going to analyse the behaviour of my networking components.
   Note  You can find all the code to run this on GitHub.     Getting Syslog data into Kafka As before, let&amp;#8217;s create ourselves a syslog connector in ksqlDB:</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve written previously about ingesting Syslog into Kafka and using KSQL to analyse it. I want to revisit the subject since it&amp;#8217;s nearly two years since I wrote about it and some things have changed since then.
 ksqlDB now includes the ability to define connectors from within it, which makes setting things up loads easier.
 You can find the full rig to run this on GitHub.
 Create and configure the Syslog connector To start with, create a source connector:</description>
