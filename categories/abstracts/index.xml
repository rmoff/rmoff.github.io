      <description>Just over a year ago, I put together the crudely-titled &amp;#34;Quick Thoughts on Not Writing a Crap Abstract&amp;#34; after reviewing a few dozen conference abstracts. This time around I’ve had the honour of being on a conference programme committee and with it the pleasure of reading 250+ abstracts—from which I have some more snarky words of wisdom to impart on the matter.
 Remind me…how does this conference game work? Before we really get into it, let’s recap how this whole game works, because plenty of people are new to conference speaking.</description>

      <description>I’ve reviewed a bunch of abstracts in the last couple of days, here are some common suggestions I made:
   No need to include your company name in the abstract text. Chances are I’ve not heard of your company, and even if I have, what does it add to my comprehension of your abstract and what you’re going to talk about? Possible exception would be the &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; tech companies where people will see a talk just because it’s Netflix etc</description>
