&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/rmoff/status/1544257707049467905&#34;&gt;src&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lightning talks are generally 5-10 minutes. As the name implies - they are quick!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good lightning talk is not just your breakout talk condensed into a shorter time frame. You can’t simply deliver the same material faster, or the same material at a higher level, or the same material with a few bits left out&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building the program for any conference is not an easy task. There will always be a speaker disappointed that their talk didn’t get in—or perhaps an audience who are disappointed that a particular talk &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; get in. As the chair of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.confluent.io/en-gb/blog/introducing-current-2022-program-committee/&#34;&gt;program committee&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=&#34;https://2022.currentevent.io/&#34;&gt;Current 22&lt;/a&gt; one of the things that I’ve found really useful in building out the program this time round are the comments that the program committee left against submissions as they reviewed them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;paragraph&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were some common patterns I saw, and I thought it would be useful to share these here. Perhaps you’re an aspiring conference speaker looking to understand what mistakes to avoid. Maybe you’re an existing speaker whose abstracts don’t get accepted as often as you’d like. Or perhaps you’re just curious as to what goes on behind the curtains :)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to win [or at least not suck] at the conference abstract submission game</title>

      <description>Just over a year ago, I put together the crudely-titled &amp;#34;Quick Thoughts on Not Writing a Crap Abstract&amp;#34; after reviewing a few dozen conference abstracts. This time around I’ve had the honour of being on a conference programme committee and with it the pleasure of reading 250+ abstracts—from which I have some more snarky words of wisdom to impart on the matter.
 Remind me…how does this conference game work? Before we really get into it, let’s recap how this whole game works, because plenty of people are new to conference speaking.</description>

      <description>I’ve reviewed a bunch of abstracts in the last couple of days, here are some common suggestions I made:
   No need to include your company name in the abstract text. Chances are I’ve not heard of your company, and even if I have, what does it add to my comprehension of your abstract and what you’re going to talk about? Possible exception would be the &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; tech companies where people will see a talk just because it’s Netflix etc</description>
