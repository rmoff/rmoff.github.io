      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve reviewed a bunch of abstracts in the last couple of days, here are some common suggestions I made:
   No need to include your company name in the abstract text. Chances are I&amp;#8217;ve not heard of your company, and even if I have, what does it add to my comprehension of your abstract and what you&amp;#8217;re going to talk about? Possible exception would be the &#34;hot&#34; tech companies where people will see a talk just because it&amp;#8217;s Netflix etc</description>
