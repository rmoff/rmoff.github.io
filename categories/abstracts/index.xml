      <description>Just over a year ago, I put together the crudely-titled &#34;Quick Thoughts on Not Writing a Crap Abstract&#34; after reviewing a few dozen conference abstracts. This time around I&amp;#8217;ve had the honour of being on a conference programme committee and with it the pleasure of reading 250+ abstracts—from which I have some more snarky words of wisdom to impart on the matter.
 Remind me…how does this conference game work? Before we really get into it, let&amp;#8217;s recap how this whole game works, because plenty of people are new to conference speaking.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve reviewed a bunch of abstracts in the last couple of days, here are some common suggestions I made:
   No need to include your company name in the abstract text. Chances are I&amp;#8217;ve not heard of your company, and even if I have, what does it add to my comprehension of your abstract and what you&amp;#8217;re going to talk about? Possible exception would be the &#34;hot&#34; tech companies where people will see a talk just because it&amp;#8217;s Netflix etc</description>
