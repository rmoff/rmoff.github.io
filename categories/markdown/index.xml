      <description>&lt;p&gt;Wordpress still, to an extent, rules the blogging world. Its longevity is testament to…something about it ;) However, it&amp;rsquo;s not my favourite platform in which to write a blog by a long way. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t support Markdown to the extent that I want. Yes, I&amp;rsquo;ve tried the plugins; no, they didn&amp;rsquo;t do what I needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like to write all my content in a structured format - ideally &lt;a href=&#34;https://asciidoc.org/&#34;&gt;Asciidoc&lt;/a&gt;, but &lt;a href=&#34;https://rmoff.net/2017/09/12/what-is-markdown-and-why-is-it-awesome/&#34;&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll settle for Markdown too&lt;/a&gt;. Here&amp;rsquo;s how I stayed [almost] sane whilst composing a blog in Markdown, reviewing it in Google Docs, and then publishing it in Wordpress in a non-lossy way.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Moving from Ghost to Hugo</title>

      <description>Why? I’ve been blogging for quite a few years now, starting on Blogger, soon onto WordPress, and then to Ghost a couple of years ago. Blogger was fairly lame, WP yucky, but I really do like Ghost. It’s simple and powerful and was perfect for my needs. My needs being, an outlet for technical content that respected formatting, worked with a markup language (Markdown), and didn’t f**k things up in the way that WP often would in its WYSIWYG handling of content.</description>

      <title>What is Markdown, and Why is it Awesome?</title>

      <description>Markdown is a plain-text formatting syntax. It enables you write documents in plain text, readable by others in plain text, and optionally rendered into nicely formatted PDF, HTML, DOCX etc.
It&amp;rsquo;s used widely in software documentation, particularly open-source, because it enables richer formatting than plain-text alone, but without constraining authors or readers to a given software platform.
Platforms such as github natively support Markdown rendering - so you write your README etc in markdown, and when viewed on github it is automagically rendered - without you needing to actually do anything.</description>
