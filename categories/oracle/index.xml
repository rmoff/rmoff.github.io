&lt;p&gt;This is one of those &lt;em&gt;you had to be there&lt;/em&gt; moments. If you come into the world of data and analytics engineering today, ELT is just what it is and is pretty much universally understood. But if you’ve been around for …&lt;em&gt;waves hands&lt;/em&gt;… longer than that, you might be confused by what people are calling ELT and ETL. Well, I was ✋.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>This is a short summary discussing what the options are for integrating Oracle RDBMS into Kafka, as of December 2018 (refreshed June 2020). For a more detailed background to why and how at a broader level for all databases (not just Oracle) see this blog and this talk.
What techniques &amp;amp; tools are there? Franck Pachot has written up an excellent analysis of the options available here.
As of June 2020, this is what the line-up looks like:</description>

      <description>The Kafka Connect JDBC Connector by default does not cope so well with:
NUMBER columns with no defined precision/scale. You may end up with apparent junk (bytes) in the output, or just errors. TIMESTAMP WITH LOCAL TIME ZONE. Throws JDBC type -102 not currently supported warning in the log. Read more about NUMBER data type in the Oracle docs.
tl;dr : How do I make it work? There are several options:</description>

      <description>This article is part of a series exploring Streaming ETL in practice. You can read about setting up the ingest of realtime events from a standard Oracle platform, and building streaming ETL using KSQL.
This post shows how we take data streaming in from an Oracle transactional system into Kafka, and simply stream it onwards into Elasticsearch. This is a common pattern, for enabling rapid search or analytics against data held in systems elsewhere.</description>

      <description>This is the detailed step-by-step if you want to recreate the process I describe in the Confluent blog here
I used Oracle&amp;rsquo;s Oracle Developer Days VM, which comes preinstalled with Oracle 12cR2. You can see the notes on how to do this here. These notes take you through installing and configuring:
Swingbench, to create a sample &amp;ldquo;Order Entry&amp;rdquo; schema and simulate events on the Oracle database Oracle GoldenGate (OGG, forthwith) and Oracle GoldenGate for Big Data (OGG-BD, forthwith) I&amp;rsquo;m using Oracle GoldenGate 12.</description>

      <description>Some notes that I made on installing and configuring Oracle GoldenGate with Confluent Platform. Excuse the brevity, but hopefully useful to share!
I used the Oracle Developer Days VM for this - it&amp;rsquo;s preinstalled with Oracle 12cR2. Big Data Lite is nice but currently has an older version of GoldenGate.
Login to the VM (oracle/oracle) and then install some useful things:
sudo rpm -Uvh https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm sudo yum install -y screen htop collectl rlwrap p7zip unzip sysstat perf iotop sudo su - cd /etc/yum.</description>

      <description>There are various reasons for this error, but the one I hit was that the table name is case sensitive, and returned from Oracle by the JDBC driver in uppercase.
If you specify the tablename in your connecter config in lowercase, it won&amp;rsquo;t be matched, and this error is thrown. You can validate this by setting debug logging (edit etc/kafka/connect-log4j.properties to set log4j.rootLogger=DEBUG, stdout), and observe: (I&amp;rsquo;ve truncated some of the output for legibility)</description>

      <description>Recently added to the oracledi project over at java.net is an adaptor enabling Oracle GoldenGate (OGG) to send data to Elasticsearch. This adds a powerful alternative to [micro-]batch extract via JDBC from Oracle to Elasticsearch, which I wrote about recently over at the Elastic blog.
Elasticsearch is a &amp;lsquo;document store&amp;rsquo; widely used for both search and analytics. It&amp;rsquo;s something I&amp;rsquo;ve written a lot about (here and here for archives), as well as spoken about - preaching the good word, as it were, since the Elastic stack as a whole is very very good at what it does and a pleasure to work with.</description>

      <title>DBMS_STATS - GATHER AUTO</title>
      <link>https://rmoff.net/2011/09/13/dbms_stats-gather-auto/</link>

      <guid>https://rmoff.net/2011/09/13/dbms_stats-gather-auto/</guid>
      <description>In Oracle 11g, the DBMS_STATS procedure GATHER_SCHEMA_STATS takes a parameter &amp;lsquo;options&amp;rsquo; which defines the scope of the objects processed by the procedure call, as well as the action. It can be either GATHER or LIST (gather the stats, or list out the objects to be touched, respectively), and AUTO, STALE or EMPTY (defining the object selection to process).
GATHER on its own will gather stats on all objects in the schema GATHER EMPTY / LIST EMPTY is self-explanatory - objects with no statistics.</description>

As well as helping track down users of troublesome queries, it also tags dump files with the OBIEE user of an offending query should the worst occur: For details, see:

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s a scenario that&amp;rsquo;ll be depressingly familiar to most reading this: after ages of running fine, and no changes to the code, a query suddenly starts running for magnitudes longer than it used to.
In this instance it was an ETL step which used to take c.1 hour, and was now at 5 hours and counting. Since it still hadn&amp;rsquo;t finished, and the gods had conspired to bring down Grid too (unrelated), I generated a SQL Monitor report to see what was happening: [sourcecode language=&amp;ldquo;sql&amp;rdquo;] select DBMS_SQLTUNE.</description>

      <description>There is a well-documented problem relating to DBMS_STATS.COPY_TABLE_STATS between partitions where high/low values of the partitioning key column were just copied verbatim from the source partition. This particular problem has now been patched (see 8318020.8). For background, see Doug Burns&amp;rsquo; blog and his excellent paper which covers the whole topic of statistics on partitioned tables.

      <description>Chucking a stick in the spokes of your carefully-tested ETL/BI &amp;hellip; My opinion is that automated stats gathering for non-system objects should be disabled on Oracle Data Warehouses across all environments.
All it does it cover up poor design or implementation which has omitted to consider statistics management. Once you get into the realms of millions or billions of rows of data, the automated housekeeping may well not have time to stat all of your tables on each run.</description>

      <description>Just because something produces the correct numbers on the report, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean you can stop there.
How you are producing those numbers matters, and matters a lot if you have an interest in the long-term health of your system and its ability to scale.
OBIEE is the case in point here, but the principle applies to any architecture with &amp;gt;1 tiers or components.
Let me start with a rhetorical question.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s an entertaining read (&amp;ldquo;Do a Proof of Concept! 94% win rate!! We can and do win against Exadata!!&amp;rdquo;), and a nice illustration of the FUD techniques that companies use in marketing their products against others.</description>

      <description>Whilst perusing the Oracle database documentation, I noticed something which caught my eye:
As well as reading the documentation online as HTML or downloading as PDF for viewing on your computer etc, you can also download it in formats (Mobi and ePub) designed for eReaders such as the Kindle and iPad (the latter obviously isn&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;just&amp;rdquo; an eReader). For information on format support, there&amp;rsquo;s a handy table on Wikipedia.
It looks like the availability of mobi/epub files isn&amp;rsquo;t universal.</description>

      <description>I wrote last year about Graphing I/O data using gnuplot and Oracle V$SYSSTAT, using a script from Kevin Closson in his article How To Produce Raw, Spreadsheet-Ready Physical I/O Data With PL/SQL. Good For Exadata, Good For Traditional Storage. Here I&amp;rsquo;ve got a simple comparison of the data recorded through this script (in essence, Oracle&amp;rsquo;s V$SYSSTAT), and directly on the OS through HP&amp;rsquo;s MeasureWare. It&amp;rsquo;s graphed out with my new favourite tool, rrdtool:</description>

      <description>Cary Millsap recently published a paper &amp;ldquo;Mastering Performance with Extended SQL Trace&amp;rdquo; describing how to use Oracle trace to assist with troubleshooting the performance of database queries. As with all of Cary Millsap&amp;rsquo;s papers it is superbly written, presenting very detailed information in a clear and understandable way. (and yes I do have a DBA crush ;-)) It discusses how you can automate the tracing of specific sessions on the database, and requiring the application to be appropriately instrumented.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing some work recently that involved the use of Materialised Views on Oracle 11g (11.1.0.7), particularly around PCT refresh. There are some things that are not clear from the documentation, or are actually bugs so far as I&amp;rsquo;m concerned, and I&amp;rsquo;ve detailed these below.
In this example I was working on part of a DWH with c.2 millions rows aggregated up daily. One of the things that I spent a long time trying to get to work was Partition Truncation when using PCT refresh.</description>

      <description>Poking around on My Oracle Support today, I found a link to a white paper dated November 2010, titled &amp;ldquo;Best Practices for a Data Warehouse on Oracle Database 11g&amp;rdquo;. It&amp;rsquo;s new to me and I&amp;rsquo;ve not noticed a blog post announcing it, so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d share it here. It&amp;rsquo;s by Maria Colgan, who has posted in the past on both the Inside the Oracle Optimizer blog and The Data Warehouse Insider blog.</description>

      <description>This is a series of posts where I hope to humbly plug some gaps in the information available (or which has escaped my google-fu) regarding statistics management in Oracle 11g specific to Data Warehousing.
Incremental Global Statistics is new functionality in Oracle 11g (and 10.2.0.4?) and is explained in depth in several places including:
Oracle® Database Performance Tuning Guide - Statistics on Partitioned Objects Greg Rahn - Oracle 11g: Incremental Global Statistics On Partitioned Tables Inside the Oracle Optimiser - Maintaining statistics on large partitioned tables Amit Poddar - One Pass Distinct Sampling (ppt - slides 52 onwards are most relevant) In essence, Oracle maintains information about each partition when statistics is gathered on the partition, and it uses this to work out the global statistics - without having to scan the whole table.</description>

      <description>Continuing in the beard-scratching theme of Unix related posts (previously - awk), here&amp;rsquo;s a way to graph out the I/O profile of your Oracle database via the Oracle metrics in gv$sysstat, and gnuplot. This is only the system I/O as observed by Oracle, so for belts &amp;amp; braces (or to placate a cynical sysadmin ;-)) you may want to cross-reference it with something like sar.
First, a pretty picture of what you can get:</description>

      <guid>https://rmoff.net/2010/09/14/the-danger-of-averages-measuring-i/o-throughput/</guid>
      <description>This query, based on AWR snapshots on sys.wrh$_sysstat, includes in its metrics the I/O read throughput for a given snapshot duration.
However it&amp;rsquo;s important to realise the huge limitation to this figure - it&amp;rsquo;s an average. It completely shoots you in the foot if you&amp;rsquo;re looking at capacity requirements.
Consider this real-life example extracted from the above query:

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a geek. I like understanding things in their absolute entirety. It frustrates me to have to make presumptions or assumptions about something. I like to get down &amp;rsquo;n dirty and find out what makes things tick.
So that necessitates reading manuals. And unfortunately, Oracle don&amp;rsquo;t make that easy all the time.
Some of the manuals are not very good, and others are difficult to find. Given the complexity of the OBIEE stack and proliferation of terminology and product names, sorting the wheat from the chaff can be a headache.</description>

      <description>Introduction We&amp;rsquo;re in the process of implemention Resource Manager (RM) on our Oracle 11gR1 Data Warehouse. We&amp;rsquo;ve currently got one DW application live, but have several more imminent. We identified RM as a suitable way of - as the name would suggest - managing the resources on the server.
In the first instance we&amp;rsquo;re looking at simply protecting CPU for, and from, future applications. At some point it would be interesting to use some of the more granular and precise functions to demote long-running queries, have nighttime/daytime plans, etc.</description>

      <description>This problem, which in essence is bad behaviour from Informatica bringing down Oracle, is a good illustration of unintended consequences of an apparently innocuous security setting. Per our company&amp;rsquo;s security standards, database passwords expire every 90 days. When this happens users are prompted to change their password before they can continue logging into Oracle. This applies to application user IDs too. It appears that Informatica 8.6.1 HF6 (part of OBIA 7.</description>

      <description>You get a call from your friendly DBA. He says the production database is up the spout, and it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;that bee eye thingumy causing it&amp;rdquo;. What do you do now? All you&amp;rsquo;ve got to go on is a program name in the Oracle session tables of &amp;ldquo;nqsserver@MYSERVER (TNS V1-V3)&amp;rdquo; and the SQL the DBA sent you that if you&amp;rsquo;re lucky will look as presentable as this: The username against the SQL is the generic User ID that you had created for connections to the database from OBIEE.</description>

      <description>Metalink was retired this weekend and made way for the new My Oracle Support system. It didn&amp;rsquo;t go as smoothly as it could have done.
This post is going to be a bit of a rambling rant.
Ultimately people, including me, don&amp;rsquo;t like their cheese being moved (not unless there&amp;rsquo;s a really runny piece of Camembert at the end of it). That makes it a bit more difficult to discuss because some of people&amp;rsquo;s complaints will just be geeks being stubborn (and boy, can geeks be stubborn).</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re upgrading from OBIA 7.9.5 (Financials - GL) to OBIA 7.9.6. Our reasons are for support (7.9.5 does not support Oracle 11g) and minor functionality additions.
Our architecture is: HP-UX 64 bit Itanium (11.31), Oracle 11g (11.1.0.7), separate ETL server, 4x OBIEE servers (2x BI, 2xPS). We have no customisations in the ETL except something for budgets, which is superseded in 7.9.6.
This post is a semi-formed articulation of my frustrations encountered during an initial run through of the upgrade in a sandbox.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m starting on an upgrade from OBIA 7.9.5 to 7.9.6 and wading through the two main docs:
7.9.6 Upgrade guide 7.9.6 Installation guide It would be nice if Oracle could come up with some less confusing terminology. It seems that not only is the whole product of OBIA referred to as OBIA (see @lex&amp;rsquo;s posting for a good explanation), but that the sub-components which are not-OBIEE-or-DAC-or-Informatica is also OBIA, c.f. page 6-1 of the Upgrade guide &amp;ldquo;[&amp;hellip;]upgrade your Oracle BI Applications environment to the current version.</description>

      <description>We routinely change Oracle passwords as part of security best-practice, I keep hitting this and keep forgetting why! :-)
[sourcecode language=&amp;lsquo;sql&amp;rsquo;] ALTER USER DAC_REPO IDENTIFIED BY 1KoBe3RH REPLACE YlR94tqp [/sourcecode]
Error report: SQL Error: ORA-00922: missing or invalid option 00922. 00000 - &amp;ldquo;missing or invalid option&amp;rdquo; *Cause: *Action:
Someone better qualified than me can explain why but I suspect it&amp;rsquo;s the leading number in the new password. Quoting the passwords then works fine:</description>

      <description>I read and post a bit on the OBIEE and OBIA OTN forums. The noise ratio isn&amp;rsquo;t too bad, but a few things really get my goat:
Not responding to answers!
If I&amp;rsquo;ve gone out of my way to help, or try to help, at least have the courtesy to acknowledge it, and ideally mark as Helpful or Correct as appropriate.
Even a simple &amp;ldquo;thanks.&amp;rdquo; would do. It&amp;rsquo;s just good manners.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m learning about a lot of the Oracle BI stack through reading manuals and trial-and-error.
One thing I&amp;rsquo;ve realised is that Metalink holds a whole heap of useful information.
For example, simply searching on &amp;ldquo;publisher cluster&amp;rdquo; throws up these two very pertinent docs:
OBIEE Clustered Installation with BI Publisher (Doc ID 744515.1) BI Publisher does not accept cluster jdbc connection strings (Doc ID 559795.1) The first one is a publically available PDF, the second one is the answer to the problem I spent more time than I needed to scratching my head over yesterday.</description>
