      <description>I wrote recently about Kibana&amp;rsquo;s excellent Timelion feature, which brings time-series visualisations to Kibana. In the comments Ben Huang asked:
 do you know how to show whats the difference between this Friday and last Friday by Timelion?
 So I thought I&amp;rsquo;d answer properly here.
Timelion includes mathematical functions including add and subtract, as well as the ability to show data offset by an amount of time. So to answer Ben&amp;rsquo;s query, we combine the two.</description>
