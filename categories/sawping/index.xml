      <description>Short but sweet this one - a way of troubleshooting connectivity problems between analytics (the Presentation Services Plug-in, either j2ee servlet or ISAPI, a.k.a. SAWBridge) and sawserver (Presentation Services).
For a recap on the services &amp;amp; flow please see the first few paragraphs of this post.
Problems in connectivity between analytics and sawserver normally manifest themselves through this error message:
500 Internal Server Error Servlet error: An exception occurred. The current application deployment descriptors do not allow for including it in this response.</description>

      <description>As a kid I loved the idea of lego where you can disassemble and reassemble something from the ground up. As soon as I got my hands on a computer it was the same. You can have your Acorn Archimedes with its games, where do I find the sprites and sound files behind it? Likewise Microsoft Word, let me at the VBA underneath to hack it around and see what else it can do.</description>
