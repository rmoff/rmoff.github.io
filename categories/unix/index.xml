      <description>I wrote last year about Graphing I/O data using gnuplot and Oracle V$SYSSTAT, using a script from Kevin Closson in his article How To Produce Raw, Spreadsheet-Ready Physical I/O Data With PL/SQL. Good For Exadata, Good For Traditional Storage. Here I&amp;rsquo;ve got a simple comparison of the data recorded through this script (in essence, Oracle&amp;rsquo;s V$SYSSTAT), and directly on the OS through HP&amp;rsquo;s MeasureWare. It&amp;rsquo;s graphed out with my new favourite tool, rrdtool:</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve added two new toys to my geek arsenal today. First is one with which I&amp;rsquo;ve dabbled before, but struggled to master. The second is a revelation to me and which I discovered courtesy of twitter.
rrdtool rrdtool is a data collection and graphing tool which I&amp;rsquo;ve been aware of for a while. I wanted to use it when I wrote about Collecting OBIEE systems management data with JMX, but couldn&amp;rsquo;t get it to work.</description>

      <description>Introduction This is the third part of three detailed articles making up a mini-series about OBIEE monitoring. It demonstrates how to capture OBIEE performance information, and optionally graph it out and serve it through an auto-updating webpage.
This final article describes how to bolt on to OAS a simple web page hosting the graphs that you created in part 2, plotting data from OBIEE collected in part 1.
The webpage This is just an old-school basic HTML page, with a meta-refresh tag (which note that Chrome doesn&amp;rsquo;t work with) and img tags: [sourcecode language=&amp;ldquo;html&amp;rdquo;] OBIEE Servers[/sourcecode]</description>

This article takes data that part one showed you how to collect into a tab-separated file that looks something like this:

      <description>They say about travelling that it&amp;rsquo;s the journey and not the destination, and the same is true with this problem we hit during a deployment to Production.
We were deploying a new OBIEE 10g implementation, with authentication provided by Microsoft Active Directory (AD) through the LDAP functionality in OBIEE. As a side note, it&amp;rsquo;s a rather nice way to do authentication, although maybe I&amp;rsquo;m biased coming from our previous implementation which used EBS integrated authentication and was a bugger to set up and work with.</description>

      <description>Continuing in the beard-scratching theme of Unix related posts (previously - awk), here&amp;rsquo;s a way to graph out the I/O profile of your Oracle database via the Oracle metrics in gv$sysstat, and gnuplot. This is only the system I/O as observed by Oracle, so for belts &amp;amp; braces (or to placate a cynical sysadmin ;-)) you may want to cross-reference it with something like sar.
First, a pretty picture of what you can get:</description>

      <description>Introduction We&amp;rsquo;re in the process of implemention Resource Manager (RM) on our Oracle 11gR1 Data Warehouse. We&amp;rsquo;ve currently got one DW application live, but have several more imminent. We identified RM as a suitable way of - as the name would suggest - managing the resources on the server.
In the first instance we&amp;rsquo;re looking at simply protecting CPU for, and from, future applications. At some point it would be interesting to use some of the more granular and precise functions to demote long-running queries, have nighttime/daytime plans, etc.</description>

      <description>Here are a couple of little unix scripts that I wrote whilst developing my performance testing OBIEE method.
They&amp;rsquo;re nothing particularly special, but may save you the couple of minutes it&amp;rsquo;d take to write them :)
Note that some of this data is available from Usage Tracking and where it is I&amp;rsquo;d recommend getting it from there, databases generally being easier to reliably and repeatably query than a transient log file.</description>

      <description>This error caught me out today. I was building a Linux VM to do some work on, and for the life of me couldn&amp;rsquo;t get the OBIEE Admin Tool to connect to the BI Server on the VM.
The error I got when trying to define a DSN on the Windows box was:
 [nQSError: 12008] Unable to connect to port 9703 on machine 10.3.105.132 [nQSError: 12010] Communication error connecting to remote end point: address = 10.</description>

      <description>Introduction Whilst the BI Cluster Controller takes care nicely of clustering and failover for BI Server (nqsserver), we have to do more to ensure further resilience of the stack.
A diagram I come back to again and again when working out configuration or connectivity problems is the one on P16 of the Deployment Guide. With this you can work out most issues for yourself through simple reasoning. Print it out, pin it to your wall, and read it!</description>

      <description>Introduction In this article I plan to get samplesales and paint repositories hosted on a single server, using one BI Server instance and two Presentation Services instances. This is on both Unix (OEL 4) and Windows, and both OC4J (OBIEE&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;basic installation&amp;rdquo; option) and OAS (&amp;ldquo;Advanced Installation&amp;rdquo;).
Both samplesales and paint are shipped with 10.1.3.4 of OBIEE, you&amp;rsquo;ll find them in $OracleBI/OracleBI/server/Sample. This article assumes you&amp;rsquo;ve got the RPD of each into $OracleBI/OracleBI/server/Repository and unpacked the web cats for each into $OracleBIdata/web/catalog.</description>

      <description>A question that pops up on the OBIEE OTN forum quite often is how to use non-Oracle databases like MS SQL Server when the OBIEE server is running on a non-Windows OS such as Linux.
The answer in a nutshell is that since version 10.1.3.3.1 OBIEE has been bundled with ODBC drivers for unix/linux from a company called DataDirect. See the release notes here for more information and installation instructions (as well as a list of support databases).</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s a set of scripts that I use on our servers as a quick way to check if the various BI components are up and running.
Because we split the stack across servers, there are different scripts called in combination. On our dev boxes we have everything and so the script calls all three sub-scripts, whereas on Production each server will run one of:
 BI Server Presentation Server &amp;amp; OAS Informatica &amp;amp; DAC  The scripts source another script called process_check.</description>

NB: if you don&amp;rsquo;t have jconsole in your path you can search for it: [sourcecode language=&amp;ldquo;bash&amp;rdquo;] $whereis jconsole jconsole: /opt/java1.5/bin/jconsole /opt/java6/bin/jconsole&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; [/sourcecode] You should find it under your java/bin directory
You should get this kind of connection dialog:  Click connect, and the console will launch.</description>

      <description>(See here and here for history)
I edited the shell script which is eventually called by run-saw.sh to start the sawserver, (OracleBI)/setup/sawserver.sh, to use trus:
Comment out the final line:
 $SASAWSERVER
 and insert as a new line:
 tusc -fepan -o /tmp/sawserver_tusc.out $SASAWSERVER
 The output of trus ended with this:

      <description>In investigating the problems with sawserver I was pointed towards a tool called tusc (which appears to be an HP version of truss).
You can use it to invoke a program, and get out a bunch of debug information including system calls.
You run it like this:
 $tusc -fep /app/oracle/product/obiee/web/bin64/sawserver64
 As a beginner when it comes to hardcore *nix I can only look at this and take pot shots at what&amp;rsquo;s going on, but with Google by my side I&amp;rsquo;m interested in the last lines of the output:</description>

      <description>If you work with a file in Windows and Unix at some point you might end up with windows line feed characters in your Unix file. It&amp;rsquo;ll look like this:
 one line of text ^M
next line ^M
and next line with more ^M
 To remove the ^M character, load the file into vi on unix and enter as a line command the following:
 :1,$s/^M//
 but instead of typing ^M do Ctrl-V Ctrl-M to get the charaters</description>

      <description>Following my previous work on configuring Publisher, I wanted to note down where the changes were written to.
The -mname syntax of the unix find command comes in handy here:
 find /app/oracle/product/obiee -mtime -1
 Shows me all files under the specified path which were modified in the last 1 day
and helpfully throws up:
 /app/oracle/product/obiee/xmlp/XMLP/Admin/DataSource/datasources.xml
