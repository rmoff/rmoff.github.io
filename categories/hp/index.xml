      <description>OK, a bit tired on a Monday morning, and so a bit sarcastic.
I&amp;rsquo;ve not really fallen off my chair, but I am shocked. I honestly didn&amp;rsquo;t think it would happen.
Oracle have finally released OBI 11g for HP-UX Itanium:
In other news, patchset 10.1.3.4.2 for OBI 10g was released today, I wonder if/when we&amp;rsquo;ll get an HP-UX Itanium version? The download page has it conspicuous by its absence even from &amp;ldquo;Coming Soon&amp;rdquo;: </description>

      <description>Chris Mellor at The Register posted an interesting article a couple of days ago, entitled HP and Violin build Oracle Exadata killer. The slidedeck has been removed from HP&amp;rsquo;s FTP site, but a bit of Google magic throws up a couple of mirror copies.
It&amp;rsquo;s an entertaining read (&amp;ldquo;Do a Proof of Concept! 94% win rate!! We can and do win against Exadata!!&amp;rdquo;), and a nice illustration of the FUD techniques that companies use in marketing their products against others.</description>
