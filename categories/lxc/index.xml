On my Proxmox 4 server I&amp;rsquo;m running a whole load of lovely LXC containers. Unfortunately, I had trouble connecting to them. From a client machine, I got the error
ssh_exchange_identification: read: Connection reset by peer  On the server I was connecting to (which I could get a console for through the Proxmox GUI, or a session on using pct enter from the Proxmox host) I ran a SSHD process with debug to see what was happening:</description>

This custom-build from Scan 3XS is sat in my study quietly humming away. I&amp;rsquo;m going to use it for hosting VMs for R&amp;amp;D on OBIEE, Big Data Lite, Elastic, InfluxDB, Kafka, etc. I&amp;rsquo;ll blog various installations that I&amp;rsquo;ve done on it as a reference for myself, and anyone else interested.</description>
