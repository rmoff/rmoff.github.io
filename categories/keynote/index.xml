      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve written recently about how I create the diagrams in my blog posts and talks, and from discussions around that, a couple of people were interested more broadly in how I use my iPad Pro. So, on the basis that if two people are interested maybe others are (and if no-one else is, I have a copy-and-paste answer to give to those two people) here we go.

      <description>So you&amp;rsquo;ve got a code sample you want to share in a presentation, but whilst it looks beautiful in your text-editor with syntax highlighting, it&amp;rsquo;s fugly in Keynote? You could screenshot it and paste the image into your slide, but you just know that you&amp;rsquo;ll want to change that code, and end up re-snapshotting itâ€¦what a PITA.
Better to have a nicely syntax-highlighted code snippet that you can paste as formatted text into Keynote and amend from there as needed.</description>
